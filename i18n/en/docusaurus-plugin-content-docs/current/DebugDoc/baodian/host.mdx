# Host Computer Guide

## How to get a new host computer running

1. First, determine the model of your host computer, whether it is Lite 2 or PI V2, etc.
2. Have you prepared the following items?
    * Burning software
    * Corresponding system image
    * Card reader, TF card, TYPE-C with data transfer function

Precautions before system burning:
    * Please ensure that the memory card capacity must not be less than `16GB` or greater than `128GB`, and the transmission speed must be `class10` or above. It is recommended to use TF cards from brands like SanDisk.
    * Do not update the system randomly!! Updating overseas servers can easily cause issues.
    * Try to use the recommended software for operations.
    * It is recommended to learn some LINUX knowledge. I personally recommend <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://item.jd.com/12443890.html">*The Bird's Linux Private Kitchen Basic Learning Chapter*</Button>, etc.

## After downloading all the necessary tools and corresponding system images

  * Extract the system. The file extension after extraction should be `.img`.
  * You need to reformat the memory card using SDFormatter.
  * Use `win32DiskImager` to burn the system into it.
  * It is not recommended to use `balenaetcher` for system burning.
  * If it is a FLY host computer, you need to open `FlyOS-Env.txt` for configuration.
  * Do not format the system after burning it!!

## Starting the System

  * After the system has been burned, install the system card into the host computer and power it on.
  * At this point, the system has been configured and burned. Use a TYPE-C with data transfer function to connect to the computer via serial port.
  * Please note that other host computers will normally display log loading. If it does not show up, press enter twice or reflash the system.
  * After starting, you can connect to WIFI.

## About M2WE and Memory Card Usage Instructions

  * If the machine is installed with M2WE and a memory card, the system will default to boot from the memory card.
  * It is recommended to use an SD card to burn the system for M2WE. Using USB to burn to M2W may fail due to driver compatibility issues. It is recommended to directly burn the memory card to M2WE.
  * Please check if the downloaded system image matches. If it doesn't match, the system will not start.
  * Please note that Lite2 and MINI PAD can only use memory cards.

## Daily Usage Precautions

  * Do not directly cut off power. Ensure a normal shutdown to prevent data loss.
  * Due to GitHud servers being overseas, it is not recommended to update or install various plugins yourself.
