# Read Before Asking Questions

  * QQ/WeChat and other communication tools provide fast and convenient ways to communicate, but if you encounter a problem, it is recommended to follow these steps.
  * Whether you can get a useful answer often depends on how you ask and follow up on your questions.

## Problem-solving Steps:

  1. Try to solve it yourself: Use the knowledge you have to try to solve the problem yourself. Don't be intimidated by English output messages; try to understand them as much as possible. Most information outputs are directional, and you just need to find them and try to solve them yourself.
  2. Search online: Look online to see if anyone has encountered a similar problem. If there is, refer to their solutions first. If not, then ask in the group.
  3. Ask in the group: When asking in the group, describe the problem clearly and attach screenshots to help others quickly locate the issue. The richer the information you prepare, the higher the efficiency of others solving your problem will be.

## To increase the chances of your question being solved quickly, try to do the following when asking:

### Always think from the perspective of the responder

  Every time you ask a question, think from the perspective of the one answering:
  * Assume that the responders are experts with precious time.
  * How can I make my question understandable at a glance? Ideally, I don’t want the responder to have to ask me what I did and what the purpose was for basic questions.
  * What makes people willing to answer my question? Is it the depth of technical discussion, the feeling of being revered, or the ability to pay directly?
  * Do not make the responder feel that I am lazy, that I haven’t read the documentation, looked at the code, checked the logs, searched, thought about it, tried it, or made any effort before asking the question.

### Clarify the problem, understand exactly what happened and what you did, including:

  * What effect or function am I trying to achieve?
  * What did I do to achieve this effect? What is the detailed process?
  * During implementation, what errors occurred and what were the symptoms (e.g., errors occurred, what error, **complete** error content? Avoid looking only at the last few lines; try to look further into the logs).
  * Did I carefully read the error message? Does the error message contain hints about the cause and solution of the error?
  * Can I solve the problem by thinking carefully according to these error messages?
  * Can I find a solution by searching the documentation, FAQs, issues, and using search engines?
  * `If you feel something in the documentation is incomplete, point it out directly!! Don’t worry about anything else, I’m not an expert and there might be overlooked aspects.`

## Inefficient or ineffective questions

  * Question: Could you please tell me how to solve this problem, big shot?

### Issues

  * *Snapshots* If you can take a screenshot, don’t take a photo. Please learn to use the various tools’ built-in screenshot features. Take a clear photo only under special circumstances.
  * *Incomplete Information* There are many reasons why the CAN cannot find the ID, such as wrong wiring, different speeds between the host machine and the slave machine, etc. Limit your problem to a specific scenario and provide specific conditions to focus on the problem.

## Question Template

Try to make your questions elegant. Don’t add unnecessary words, complaints, and carefully consider each word and punctuation mark. Think from the responder’s perspective: how can I make the responder quickly help me solve the problem? Too few words make it hard to describe, while too many words make people lose patience.

### If you really can’t solve the problem yourself and need to ask someone, consider:

  * Who should I ask and where should I ask? Who is more likely to answer my question and what is the real-time response like?

  * What information and phenomena should I provide to make them willing to help me quickly?
    * Provide my purpose (to help the responder know what you are doing).
    * Provide the complete implementation process and the phenomena during the process (to help the responder follow your steps and reproduce the problem).
    * Point out where the error occurred, and specify where the phenomenon or result differs from your expectations! (Let the responder know where the expectation is not met.)
    * Provide the error information, and include as many screenshots and logs as possible. Don’t be stingy with small screenshots or partial logs (because the responder may not have done this task in a long time and may forget some details. Screenshots and complete logs help them quickly recall the details; and detailed logs can help quickly pinpoint the problem).

  * How to show a sincere attitude when asking, even if I am a beginner, everyone is willing to answer.

### Title

  Regardless of where you ask, come up with a title of about **30** characters that explains the core idea of your problem, including:
  * Problem category, whether it's a question, a bug report, or an experience share, etc. This helps others immediately identify what you are trying to do in a sea of text.
  * A brief statement of the core idea of your problem, such as encountering "CAN cannot find ID," "mainboard connection failure," etc.

  So a comprehensive title could be:
  * `【Question】SHT36V3 cannot find CANID after confirming everything`

  Titles that should definitely **not** appear:
  * `Ah ah ah ah why can't my board find the ID` (I don't know, I don’t know how you wired and operated it).
  * `Why won’t my host machine start` (I don’t know, I don’t know which host machine you are referring to).
  * `Why don’t I have a device here` (I don’t know, I don’t know which product you are talking about).
  * `What’s this error` (Didn’t read the documentation, jumped right into asking).
  * `Received the motherboard, how to connect the driver` (Didn’t read the documentation, jumped right into asking).
  * `How to connect this wire` (What’s the problem?).
  * `Why can’t I burn after entering DFU, why can’t I enter DFU` (You need to tell everyone how you operate and how you connect the wires, otherwise, others might think you’re just making things up and ignore you).

  You could ask like this instead:
  * `【Question】After reversing the power supply on my board, the board can no longer start. How can I determine which part is burned out, and if possible, how can I revive it?`
  * `【Bug】This documentation is incomplete at this point, hope to add or modify similar content.`

### Reference Template

  * Please spend a little time organizing your question and describing the following information:
  * Whether you can get a useful answer often depends on how you ask and follow up on your questions.

  1. **What is the problem** Example: New motherboard and tool version cannot find devices.
  2. **What hardware equipment** Example: Set-top box + D5 motherboard + SHT36V3.
  3. **How to wire** Example: Take high-definition pictures of the wiring and send them to the expert.
  4. **What problem phenomenon** Example: Host machine input **lsusb** does not find any devices. Attach a full information screenshot.

  【Question】I bought a D5 motherboard and SHT36, and when connecting to the set-top box and using **lsusb**, I cannot find any devices.
