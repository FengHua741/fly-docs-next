# Determine the Issue Based on Error Messages

    * Below are common error messages
        * OSError: [Errno 19] No such device
        * can.CanError: Failed to transmit: [Errno 100] Network is down
        * can.CanError: Failed to transmit: [Errno 105] No buffer space available
    * The first one indicates that the upper computer cannot find the `1d50:606f` device
    * The second one indicates that the upper computer has not been configured or has misconfigured CAN0
    * The third one indicates that the upper computer's cache is insufficient or there is a system issue leading to cache failure
    * The second and third points can be checked by configuring CAN0 as shown below for troubleshooting
    * If you cannot find the ID, please refer to the bottom

## Check if the Upper Computer Supports CAN

    * If you are using the FLY upper computer, this step is unnecessary
    * If your system is `Ubuntu`, it is recommended to replace the system as configuring CAN in this system is troublesome; it is advised to switch systems
    * Enter the command below to determine if the system supports CAN

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe can && echo "Your kernel supports CAN" || echo "Your kernel does not support CAN"
    ```

    * After entering the above command, if your kernel supports CAN, it will return: `Your kernel supports CAN`; if not, it will return: `Your kernel does not support CAN`.

## Configure CAN0

    * This command overrides the original system CAN0 configuration, and after execution, the system needs to be restarted
    
    * For 1M speed, enter the following command
----
    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
        allow-hotplug can0
        iface can0 can static
            bitrate 1000000
            up ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1024
            pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
            pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```
----
    * For 500K speed, enter the following command

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 500000
        up ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1024
        pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
        pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    * Restart the device

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## Pay Attention to the Following Areas if You Cannot Find the ID

    * If Klipper is configured with the corresponding ID, you need to disable the ID in the system configuration before shutting down, disconnecting power, then restarting or resetting the motherboard
    * Check if the CAN speed of the upper computer matches the motherboard, tool board, etc.
    * You can use the code below to confirm the CAN speed of the upper computer
    * Confirm whether there is a disconnection
    ```bash
    ip -details link show can0
    ```
    * The circled parts in the image below indicate the CAN speed and cache of the upper computer
    * The above `1024` is the current CAN0 cache
    * The below `1000000` is the current CAN0 speed

    * If the UUID still cannot be queried, carefully check the following notes

        * Check if the motherboard or CAN tool board is correctly connected
        * Check if the power supply is correct; it is recommended to connect VCC power when using the motherboard
        * Check if the upper computer supports CAN network
        * Check if the firmware compilation is correct
## Search for ID

    * Enter the following command to search for the ID
    ```bash
    ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```
    * If an ID appears and the last part of the output shows `Application: Klipper`, it means this ID can be used directly
    * If an ID appears and the last part of the output shows `Application: CANBOOT` or `Katapult`, it means you need to flash the firmware to use it

## Method to Configure CAN ID

    * Open the printer's web interface, find `printer.cfg` under the configuration options in the left sidebar:
        * fluidd: `{â€¦}`
        * mainsail: `Machine`
        * Click to enter

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />

    * Copy the queried UUID and paste it into the `canbus_uuid:` field in the `[mcu]` section of the `printer.cfg` configuration. Save and restart to connect to the motherboard. If Klipper prompts that the firmware needs updating or ADC errors occur, it indicates that Klipper has connected to the motherboard
