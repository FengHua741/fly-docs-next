* Printers with the `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` feature should remember to perform multi-z leveling.

### Step 1: Calibrate EDDY
* Click on the macro command `CALIBRATE_EDDY` as shown in the image and click execute.
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/img/eddy5.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />
* Then the following UI interface will appear.
* Use an A4 paper to adjust the Z-offset. Before adjusting the `z-offset` value, check the Klipper documentation tutorial for the `paper test` [here](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test).
* Once you find the appropriate value, click `ACCEPT`.

* After calibration is complete, save the parameters by clicking `SAVE_CONFIG`.

### Step 2: Temperature Compensation
:::info
* Please do not heat the heated bed or nozzle before performing temperature compensation.
:::

* Execute the macro command `TEMP_COMPENSATION` as shown in the image and click execute.

1. After executing this operation, the UI will display a Z-axis adjustment box. Please use the manual `[Z-axis offset calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test)` mentioned above, place a piece of paper between the nozzle and the bed, and then confirm the value.
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/UI.webp').default} size="30%" align="left" />
2. After accepting the value, the heated bed will automatically be set to 80°C and the nozzle to 250°C.
3. If you are in a room with an air conditioner or open windows, it is recommended to turn off the air conditioner or close the windows to ensure that Eddy's temperature rises, as wind can affect the temperature increase.
4. As Eddy's temperature rises, the system will prompt you to manually calibrate the Z offset every 3°C. The heated bed is very hot, so be careful not to burn yourself!!!

5. Repeat the manual Z offset calibration (Paper Test) until the calibration is complete. If you find that Eddy's temperature no longer increases, you can use the following relevant commands to end the calibration early.

* Additional G-code commands available during drift calibration include:
* `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT` is used to force Eddy to sample new data before reaching the target temperature of `80°C` for EDDy.
* `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE` is used to complete the calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature of `80°C`.
* `ABORT` can be used to terminate the calibration and ignore the results.
* When calibration is complete, use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the temperature offset settings!
* In summary, compared to most other procedures, the above calibration process is more challenging and time-consuming. It may require practice and multiple attempts to provide excellent first-layer printing results over a wide range of temperatures!

## How to Fine-Tune z-offset
* Step 1: Use pursa/OrcaSlicer/cura/Bambu Studio to slice a 200x200 square with a height of 0.2mm to print for fine-tuning the z-offset.
* Step 2: Enter `fluidd` or `mainsail` through the printer's IP address to find the dashboard `Movement Control` and fine-tune the z-axis offset `z_OFFSET`.
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/Zoff.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />
* After calibration is complete, save the parameters by clicking `SAVE_CONFIG`.

## Adjustment Commands When Values Do Not Change
* Use the following command to adjust the Z-offset. The value adjusted in the popped-up UI interface is the value adjusted during the print process [Paper test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test)
```bash
G28
PROBE_CALIBRATE METHOD=AUTO  
```
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/UI.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />
* After calibration is complete, save the parameters by clicking `SAVE_CONFIG`.

:::info
* If the above operations are completed but the bed scraping fails, change the Z limit to a virtual limit, overriding the original `endstop_pin` with `endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop`.
