        * Printers with the `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` feature should perform multi-Z leveling.

### Step 1: Calibrate EDDY
* Click the macro command `CALIBRATE_EDDY` as shown in the image and execute it.
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/img/eddy5.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />
* Then a UI interface will appear.
* Use A4 paper to adjust the Z-offset. Before adjusting the `z-offset` value, check the Klipper documentation tutorial on [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test).
* Once you find the appropriate value, click `ACCEPT`.

* After calibration is complete, save the parameters with `SAVE_CONFIG`.

### Step 2: Temperature Compensation
:::info
        * Do not heat the heated bed or nozzle before performing temperature compensation.
:::

* Execute the macro command `TEMP_COMPENSATION` as shown in the images and click execute.

1. After executing this operation, the UI will display a Z-axis adjustment box. Please use the manual [Z-axis offset calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) mentioned above. Insert a piece of paper between the nozzle and the bed, then confirm the value.
2. After accepting the value, set the heated bed temperature to the highest setting and the nozzle temperature to 250℃.
3. If you are in a room with an air conditioner or open windows, it is recommended to turn off the air conditioner or close the windows to ensure that the Eddy temperature rises, as wind can affect the temperature increase.
4. As the Eddy temperature rises, the system will automatically prompt you to perform a manual Z-offset calibration every 3℃. The heated bed temperature is very high, be careful not to burn yourself!!!
5. Repeat the manual Z-offset calibration (Paper Test) until calibration is complete. If you notice that the Eddy temperature no longer increases, you can use the following relevant commands to end the calibration early.

* Additional G-code commands available during drift calibration include: TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT
* `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT` is used to force Eddy to sample new data before reaching the target temperature of 80℃ for EDDy.
* `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE` is used to complete calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature of 80℃.
* `ABORT` can be used to terminate the calibration and ignore the results.
* When calibration is complete, use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the temperature offset settings!
* In summary, compared to most other programs, the above calibration process is more challenging and time-consuming. It may require practice and multiple attempts to provide excellent first-layer print results across a wide range of temperatures!

## Adjust z-offset/z compensation
* Use the following commands to adjust the Z-offset with an A4 paper. Before adjusting the `z-offset` value, check the Klipper documentation tutorial on [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test).
```bash
G28
PROBE_CALIBRATE METHOD=AUTO  
```
* Once you find the appropriate value, click `ACCEPT`.

* After calibration is complete, save the parameters with `SAVE_CONFIG`.       

## How to fine-tune z-offset
* Step 1: Use pursa/OrcaSlicer/cura/Bambu Studio to slice a 200x200 square with a height of 0.2mm to print and fine-tune the z-offset.
* Step 2: Through the printer's IP, enter `fluidd` or `mainsail`, find the dashboard, and adjust the Z-axis offset using the movement control to continue fine-tuning the z_OFFSET. Remember the fine-tuned value.
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/Zoff.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />
* Step 3: Restart Klipper with the following command:
```bash
FIRMWARE_RESTART
```
* Step 4: Use the following command to adjust the Z-offset. The adjusted value is the value adjusted during printing using [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test).
```bash
G28
PROBE_CALIBRATE METHOD=AUTO  
```
<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/UI.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />
* After calibration is complete, save the parameters with `SAVE_CONFIG`.

:::info
 * After completing the above operations, if the bed sweeping fails, change the Z limit to a virtual limit, overriding the original endstop_pin `endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop`.
