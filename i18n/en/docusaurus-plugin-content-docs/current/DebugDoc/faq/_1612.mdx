## How to Fine-Tune Z-Offset
* First step: Use Prusa/OrcaSlicer/Cura/Bambu Studio to slice a 200x200 square with a height of 0.2mm to print and fine-tune the Z-offset
* Second step: Enter `fluidd` `mainsail` via the printer's IP, locate the dashboard, and adjust the Z-axis offset under "Move Control" to fine-tune the Z_OFFSET, then remember the adjusted value

* Third step: Restart Klipper with the following command
```bash
FIRMWARE_RESTART
```
* Fourth step: Adjust the Z-offset through the UI interface that pops up after running the following commands. The adjustment value should be the one adjusted during printing
```bash
G28
PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
```

:::info
* If you encounter the error `Eddy current sensor error`, increase the z_offset value in the eddy configuration, as shown in the example

## Operation Instructions

    :::warning Note

    * Please ensure current calibration is done before coil frequency calibration
    * For multi-Z axis machines, manual leveling is required once, do all calibrations, then level again, and recalibrate
    * The firmware of the lower-level machine must be completely consistent with the Klipper version

    * Please ensure current calibration is done before coil frequency calibration

    * The firmware of the lower-level machine must be completely consistent with the Klipper version

    :::

    * Please add the following configuration to the `FUIDD` webpage before performing the following operations
        ```cfg
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    ### Step One: Calibrate Eddy Current

        * 1: Enter the following command in the console
            ```bash
            SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION z=80
            ```
        * 2: Home X and Y, move the toolhead to the center of the bed
            ```bash
            G28 X Y
            ```
        * After completing the above steps, Eddy current calibration is needed. First, move Eddy to the center of the bed, then let the nozzle just touch the bed. Then execute the following command in the console to automatically obtain the current, and finally `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters. A feedback value around 15 is normal; a value of 0 or 30 indicates a connection issue (poor contact)
            ```bash
            LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * The normal return value should be around `15`
        * After calibration, `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters

    ### Step Two: Calibrate Eddy Frequency

        :::info

        * When installing Eddy, its bottom should be at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle
        * During Eddy frequency calibration, the coil PCB should be at least 5mm away from the bed

        :::

        * Then move the nozzle to the center of the platform (note: ensure the machine does not have a heightmap loaded)
        * Begin manual Z-offset calibration [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test)
            ```bash
            PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * After calibration, `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters
        :::info
        * For printers with `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` functionality, adjust the parallelism first (i3 adjusts the X-axis parallelism, trident adjusts bed parallelism, Voron 2.4 adjusts gantry parallelism), then recalibrate the Eddy frequency
        :::
    ### Step Three: Temperature Compensation

        * Home all axes
       ```bash
       G28
       ```

        * If there is `[quad_gantry_level]` or `[z_tilt]`, run `Z_TILT_ADJUST` or `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` once, then home again
        * In the console, enter G0 Z5 or move the Z-axis to 5mm above the bed via the webpage or other means
        * Execute the following code to set the machine's `idle timeout` to a longer period, to prevent timeout during the heating process
            ```bash
            SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=65000
            ```
        * Execute the following command to start calibration
            ```bash
            TEMPERATURE_PROBE_CALIBRATE PROBE=fly_eddy_probe TARGET=56 STEP=4
            ```
        :::warning Note

        * Tip: In the above command, the Eddy target temperature is set to `56℃`, which suits most devices.
        * If the actual temperature inside your 3D printer enclosure is higher, you can appropriately increase the target temperature.
        * Please note, the higher the target temperature, the longer the calibration will take, as Eddy needs more time to reach temperature equilibrium.

        :::
    
        1. After executing this operation, the UI will display the Z-axis adjustment box. Please use the manual [Z-axis offset calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) mentioned above, place a piece of paper between the nozzle and the bed, and confirm this value.
        2. After accepting the value, set the bed temperature to its maximum, and the nozzle temperature to 220℃.
        3. If you are in a room with air conditioning or open windows, it is recommended to turn off the air conditioning or close the windows to ensure Eddy's temperature rises, as wind can affect the temperature increase.
        4. As Eddy's temperature rises, the system will automatically prompt you to perform a manual Z-offset calibration every 4℃. The bed temperature is very high, so be cautious of burns!!!
        5. Repeat the manual Z-offset calibration (Paper Test) until calibration is complete. If Eddy's temperature does not rise further, you can use the following related commands to end the calibration early.
        
        * Additional gcode commands available during drift calibration include: TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT`    Used to force Eddy to sample new data before reaching the set target temperature of `56℃`.
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE`    Used to complete calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature of `56℃`.
            * `ABORT`  Can be used to terminate calibration and ignore the results.
        * After completing these steps, Eddy will provide excellent first-layer printing results across a wide range of temperatures!
## Various Optimization Macros

    ### `[quad_gantry_level]` Bed Scanning Optimization
        * If you have `[quad_gantry_level]` configured, you can add the following macro to the configuration, otherwise, it's not needed
        * This macro will lower the probe height as the gantry height difference decreases
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL]
            rename_existing: _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.quad_gantry_level.applied %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
            ```

    ### `[z_tilt]` Bed Scanning Optimization

        * If you have `[z_tilt]` configured, you can add the following macro to the configuration, otherwise, it's not needed
        * This macro will lower the probe height as the gantry height difference decreases
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro Z_TILT_ADJUST]
            rename_existing: _Z_TILT_ADJUST
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.z_tilt.applied %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
            ```

    ### Bed Scanning Optimization

        * If you're using a high-power AC bed (500W or above)
        * The following macro turns off the bed during scanning and reheats it after the scan
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
            rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
            gcode:
                {% set TARGET_TEMP = printer.heater_bed.target %}
                M140 S0
                _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE {rawparams}
                M140 S{TARGET_TEMP}
            ```
    ## Bed Mesh Commands
    
        * Command to scan the entire bed mesh
            ```bash
            BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan
            ```
        * Local bed mesh command, ensure Klipper can use object exclusion functionality, recommended to add to the start macro
            ```bash
            BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan adaptive=1 
            ```
