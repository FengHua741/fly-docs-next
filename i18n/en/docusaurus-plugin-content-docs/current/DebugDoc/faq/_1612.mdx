## How to Fine-Tune Z-offset
* Step 1: Use Prusa/OrcaSlicer/Cura/Bambu Studio to slice a 200x200 square piece with a height of 0.2 for printing to fine-tune z-offset.
* Step 2: Access `fluidd` or `mainsail` via the printer's IP, find the dashboard, adjust the z-axis offset under `move control` to further fine-tune z-offset, and remember the adjustment value.

* Step 3: Restart Klipper with the following command:
```bash
FIRMWARE_RESTART
```
* Step 4: Adjust the Z-offset through the UI interface that appears after running the following commands. The value to adjust is the one noted during the print adjustment process:
```bash
G28
PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
```

* If you encounter the error `Eddy current sensor error`, increase the z_offset value in the eddy configuration, refer to the example image.

## Operation Instructions

    :::warning Precautions

    * Please perform current calibration before coil frequency calibration.
    * For machines with multiple Z axes, manual leveling is required once before performing all calibrations, then level again after calibration.
    * Ensure that the firmware version of the lower computer is completely consistent with the Klipper version.

    :::

    * Please add the configuration below in the `FLUIDD` webpage before performing the following operations:
        ```cfg
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    ### Step 1: Calibrating Eddy Current

        * 1: Enter the following command in the console:
            ```bash
            SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION z=80
            ```
        * 2: Home X and Y, move the toolhead to the center of the bed:
            ```bash
            G28 X Y
            ```
        * After completing the above steps, you need to calibrate the Eddy current. First, move Eddy to the center of the bed, then adjust the nozzle to just touch the bed. Execute the following command in the console to automatically get the current, then `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters. A normal feedback value is around 15. Feedback of 0 or 30 indicates a connection issue (poor contact).
            ```bash
            LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * The normal return value should be around `15`.
        * After calibration, use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters.

    ### Step 2: Calibrating Eddy Frequency

        :::info

        * When installing Eddy, ensure its bottom is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.
        * When calibrating the Eddy frequency, the coil PCB should be at least 5mm away from the bed.

        :::

        * Then move the nozzle to the center of the platform (note: ensure the machine does not have a loaded heightmap at this step).
        * Start manual Z-offset calibration [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test):
            ```bash
            PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * After calibration, use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters.
        :::info
        * For printers with `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` features, adjust the parallelism first (I3 adjust X-axis parallelism, trident adjust bed parallelism, Voron 2.4 adjust gantry parallelism) before recalibrating Eddy frequency.
        :::
    ### Step 3: Temperature Compensation

        * Home all axes:
       ```bash
       G28
       ```

        * If you have `[quad_gantry_level]` or `[z_tilt]`, run `Z_TILT_ADJUST` or `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` once, then home again.
        * In the console, enter G0 Z5 or move the Z-axis 5mm above the bed through the webpage.
        * Execute the following code to extend the machine's `idle timeout` to prevent timeout during the heating process:
            ```bash
            SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=65000
            ```
        * Execute the following command to start calibration:
            ```bash
            TEMPERATURE_PROBE_CALIBRATE PROBE=fly_eddy_probe TARGET=56 STEP=4
            ```
        :::warning Precautions

        * Note: In the command above, the Eddy target temperature is set to `56℃`, which suits most devices.
        * If the actual temperature in your 3D printer chamber is higher, you can increase the target temperature accordingly.
        * Please note that the higher the target temperature, the longer the calibration will take as Eddy needs more time to reach temperature equilibrium.

        :::
    
        1. After executing this operation, the UI will show a Z-axis adjustment box. Please use the manual [Z-axis offset calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) mentioned above, place the paper between the nozzle and the bed, then confirm the value.
        2. After accepting the value, set the bed temperature to the highest, and the nozzle temperature to 220℃.
        3. If you are in a room with air conditioning or open windows, it is recommended to turn off the AC or close the windows to ensure Eddy's temperature rises, as wind can affect the temperature increase.
        4. As Eddy's temperature rises, the system will prompt you to perform manual Z-offset calibration every 4℃. Be cautious of burns due to high bed temperatures!!!
        5. Repeat the manual Z-offset calibration (Paper Test) until calibration is complete. If Eddy's temperature stops rising, you can use the related commands below to end calibration early.
        
        * Additional gcode commands available during drift calibration include: TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT`    Used to force Eddy to sample new data before reaching the set target temperature of `56℃`.
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE`    Used to complete calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature of `56℃`.
            * `ABORT`  Can be used to terminate calibration and ignore results.
        * After completing these steps, Eddy will provide excellent first layer print results over a wide range of temperatures!
## Various Optimization Macros

    ### `[quad_gantry_level]` Bed Leveling Optimization
        * If you have configured `[quad_gantry_level]`, you can add the macro below to the configuration; if not, no need to add it.
        * This macro reduces the probe height as the gantry height difference decreases:
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL]
            rename_existing: _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.quad_gantry_level.applied %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
            ```

    ### `[z_tilt]` Bed Leveling Optimization

        * If you have configured `[z_tilt]`, you can add the macro below to the configuration; if not, no need to add it.
        * This macro reduces the probe height as the gantry height difference decreases:
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro Z_TILT_ADJUST]
            rename_existing: _Z_TILT_ADJUST
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.z_tilt.applied %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
            ```

    ### Bed Leveling Optimization

        * If using a high-power AC bed (over 500W)
        * The macro below turns off the bed during leveling and reheats it after leveling is complete:
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
            rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
            gcode:
                {% set TARGET_TEMP = printer.heater_bed.target %}
                M140 S0
                _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE {rawparams}
                M140 S{TARGET_TEMP}
            ```
    ## Bed Mesh Commands
    
        * Add the following macro in the `printer.cfg` configuration:
            ```bash
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
             rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
             gcode: 
                   _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan {rawparams}
            ```
        * For local bed mesh commands, ensure Klipper can use the object exclusion feature, it's recommended to add this to the start macro:
            ```bash
            BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan adaptive=1 
            ```
