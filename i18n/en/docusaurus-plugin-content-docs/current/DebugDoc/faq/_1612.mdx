## How to Fine-Tune Z-offset

* Step One: Use Prusa/OrcaSlicer/Cura/Bambu Studio to slice a 200x200 square piece with a height of 0.2 for printing to fine-tune the z-offset.
* Step Two: Access `fluidd` or `mainsail` through the printer's IP, locate the dashboard's `Movement Control`, and continue fine-tuning the z-offset. Remember the adjusted value.

* Step Three: Restart Klipper with the following command:
```bash
FIRMWARE_RESTART
```
* Step Four: Adjust the Z-offset with the following commands, and the value adjusted during printing will appear in the UI:
```bash
G28
PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
```

* If you encounter the error `Eddy current sensor error`, increase the z_offset value in the eddy configuration, as shown in the illustration.

 * If the bed leveling fails after completing the above steps, switch the z limit to a virtual limit.

## Operation Instructions

    :::warning Attention

    * Please perform current calibration before coil frequency calibration.
    * Multi-Z axis machines need to manually level once, perform all calibrations, then level again before recalibrating.
    * The firmware version of the lower machine must be identical to the Klipper version.

    :::

    * Please add the following configuration to the `FUIDD` webpage before executing the subsequent steps:
        ```cfg
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    ### Step One: Calibrating Eddy Current

        * 1: Enter the following command in the console:
            ```bash
            SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION z=80
            ```
        * 2: Home X and Y, move the tool head to the center of the bed:
            ```bash
            G28 X Y
            ```
        * After completing the above steps, you need to calibrate the Eddy current. First, move Eddy to the center of the bed and ensure the nozzle just touches the bed. Then, execute the following command in the console to automatically obtain the current, and use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters. A normal feedback value is around 15; if it's 0 or 30, check the connections (poor contact):
            ```bash
            LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * The normal return value should be around `15`.
        * After calibration, use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters.

    ### Step Two: Calibrating Eddy Frequency

        :::info

        * When installing Eddy, ensure the bottom is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.
        * When calibrating Eddy frequency, keep the coil PCB at least 5 mm away from the bed.

        :::

        * Then move the nozzle to the center of the platform (Note: Ensure the machine does not have a loaded heightmap).
        * Begin manual z-offset calibration [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test):
            ```bash
            PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * After calibration, use `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters.
        :::info
        * For printers with `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` functions, first adjust the parallelism (i3 adjust X-axis parallelism, trident adjust bed parallelism, Voron 2.4 adjust gantry parallelism) before recalibrating Eddy frequency.
        :::
    ### Step Three: Temperature Compensation

        * Home all axes:
       ```bash
       G28
       ```

        * If there's `[quad_gantry_level]` or `[z_tilt]`, run `Z_TILT_ADJUST` or `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` first, then home again.
        * Enter G0 Z5 in the console or move the Z-axis 5mm above the bed via the webpage.
        * Execute the following code to set the machine's `idle timeout` longer to avoid timeout during the heating process:
            ```bash
            SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=65000
            ```
        * Execute the following command to start calibration:
            ```bash
            TEMPERATURE_PROBE_CALIBRATE PROBE=fly_eddy_probe TARGET=56 STEP=4
            ```
        :::warning Attention

        * Note: In the above command, the Eddy target temperature is set to `56℃`, suitable for most devices.
        * If your 3D printer's chamber temperature is higher, you can increase the target temperature accordingly.
        * Please note that the higher the target temperature, the longer the calibration will take, as Eddy needs more time to reach temperature equilibrium.

        :::

        1. After executing this operation, the UI will display the Z-axis adjustment box. Use the aforementioned manual [Z-offset Calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test), insert the paper between the nozzle and the bed, and confirm the value.
        2. After accepting the value, set the bed temperature to its maximum, and the nozzle temperature to 220℃.
        3. If you are in an air-conditioned or window-open room, it is recommended to turn off the air conditioning or close the windows to ensure Eddy's temperature rises, as wind affects the temperature increase.
        4. As Eddy's temperature rises, the system will automatically prompt you to perform manual Z-offset calibration every 4℃. Be careful of burns due to the high bed temperature!
        5. Repeat the manual Z-offset calibration (Paper Test) until calibration is complete. If Eddy's temperature does not rise, you can use the following related commands to end the calibration prematurely.

        * Additional gcode commands available during drift calibration include: TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT`    Forces Eddy to sample new data before reaching the target temperature of `56℃`.
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE`    Completes calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature of `56℃`.
            * `ABORT`  Can be used to terminate calibration and ignore results.
        * After completing these steps, Eddy will provide excellent first layer prints across a wide temperature range!
## Various Optimization Macros

    ### `[quad_gantry_level]` Bed Leveling Optimization
        * If `[quad_gantry_level]` is configured, add the following macro to the configuration; if not, it's not needed.
        * This macro reduces the probe height as the gantry height difference decreases:
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL]
            rename_existing: _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.quad_gantry_level.applied %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
            ```

    ### `[z_tilt]` Bed Leveling Optimization

        * If `[z_tilt]` is configured, add the following macro to the configuration; if not, it's not needed.
        * This macro reduces the probe height as the gantry height difference decreases:
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro Z_TILT_ADJUST]
            rename_existing: _Z_TILT_ADJUST
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.z_tilt.applied %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
            ```

    ### Bed Leveling Optimization

        * If using a high-power AC bed (over 500W)
        * The following macro turns off the bed during leveling and reheats it after leveling is complete:
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
            rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
            gcode:
                {% set TARGET_TEMP = printer.heater_bed.target %}
                M140 S0
                _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE {rawparams}
                M140 S{TARGET_TEMP}
            ```
    ## Bed Mesh Commands
    
        * Add the following macro to the `printer.cfg` configuration:
            ```bash
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
             rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
             gcode: 
                   _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan {rawparams}
            ```
        * Local bed mesh command, ensure Klipper can use the object exclusion feature, suggested to add to the start macro:
            ```bash
            BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan adaptive=1 
            ```
