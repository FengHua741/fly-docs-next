## Instructions

    :::warning Attention

    * Please perform current calibration before coil frequency calibration.
    * For multi-Z-axis machines, manually level once, complete all calibrations, then level again before recalibrating.
    * The firmware of the lower machine must match the Kliiper version exactly.

    * Please perform current calibration before coil frequency calibration.
    * For multi-Z-axis machines, manually level once, complete all calibrations, then level again before recalibrating.
    * The firmware of the lower machine must match the Kliiper version exactly.

    :::

    * Please use the `FUIDD` web page to add the following configuration before proceeding with the operations:
        ```cfg
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    ### Step Two: Calibrate EDDY Current

        * 1: Enter the following command in the console:
            ```bash
            SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION z=80
            ```
        * 2: Home X and Y, then move the toolhead to the center of the bed:
            ```bash
            G28 X Y
            ```
        * After completing the above steps, calibrate the Eddy current. First, move Eddy to the center of the bed, then lower the nozzle until it just touches the bed. Then execute the following command in the console to automatically get the current, and finally `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters. A feedback value around 15 is normal; if it's 0 or 30, check for proper connection (poor contact).
            ```bash
            LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * The normal return value should be around `15`.
        * After calibration, `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters.

    ### Step Two: Calibrate Eddy Frequency

        :::info

        * When installing Eddy, ensure the eddy ocb board is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.
        * During Eddy frequency calibration, keep the coil PCB at least 5mm away from the bed.
        * This 5mm distance is to facilitate the next step of using a tissue to get the `z_offset`.

        :::

        * Then move the nozzle to the center of the platform (Note: Ensure the machine does not have a loaded heightmap at this step).
        * Begin manual z-offset calibration [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test):
            ```bash
            PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * After calibration, `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters.
        :::info
        * For printers with `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` functionality, adjust the parallelism first (adjust X-axis parallelism for i3, bed parallelism for trident, gantry parallelism for Voron 2.4), then recalibrate the Eddy frequency.
        :::

    ### Step Three: Temperature Compensation
        * Step Three: Temperature compensation needs to be successful before proceeding.

        * Home all axes:
       ```bash
       G28
       ```

        * If there is `[quad_gantry_level]` or `[z_tilt]`, run `Z_TILT_ADJUST` or `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` once, then home again.
        * Enter `G0 Z5` in the console or use the web interface to move the Z-axis to 5mm above the bed.
        * Execute the following code to set the machine's `idle timeout` longer, to avoid timeout during the heating process:
            ```bash
            SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=65000
            ```
        * Execute the following command to start calibration:
            ```bash
            TEMPERATURE_PROBE_CALIBRATE PROBE=fly_eddy_probe TARGET=56 STEP=4
            ```
        :::warning Attention

        * Tip: In the above command, the EDDy target temperature is set to `56℃`, which is suitable for most devices.
        * If the actual temperature of your 3D printer enclosure is higher, you can adjust the target temperature accordingly.
        * Please note, the higher the target temperature, the longer the calibration will take, as Eddy needs more time to reach thermal equilibrium.

        1. After executing this operation, the UI will display a Z-axis adjustment box. Please use the manual [Z-axis offset calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) mentioned above to insert a sheet of paper between the nozzle and the bed, then confirm this value.
        2. After accepting the value, set the bed temperature to its highest, and the nozzle temperature to 220℃.
        3. If you are in a room with air conditioning or open windows, to ensure Eddy's temperature rises, it is recommended to turn off the air conditioning or close the windows, as wind can affect the temperature rise.
        4. As Eddy's temperature rises, the system will prompt you to perform manual Z-offset calibration every 4℃. Be careful of burns due to high bed temperature!!!
        5. Repeat the manual Z-offset calibration (Paper Test) until calibration is complete. If Eddy's temperature stops rising, you can use the following related commands to end calibration early.

        * Additional gcode commands available during drift calibration include: TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT`    Used to force Eddy to sample new data before reaching the set target temperature `56℃`.
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE`    Used to complete calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature `56℃`.
            * `ABORT`  Can be used to terminate calibration and ignore the results.
        * After completing these steps, Eddy will be able to provide excellent first-layer printing results across a wide range of temperatures!

## How to Fine-Tune Z-Offset
* Step One: Slice a 200x200mm, 0.2mm high square piece using Prusa/OrcaSlicer/Cura/Bambu Studio to print and fine-tune z-offset.
* Step Two: Enter the printer's IP to access `fluidd` or `mainsail`, find the dashboard's `Move Control` to further adjust z-offset, then remember the adjusted value.

* Step Three: Restart Klipper using the following command:
```bash
FIRMWARE_RESTART
```
* Step Four: Use the following command to adjust Z-offset. The UI interface will appear, adjust the `z-offset` to the value you noted during printing:
```bash
G28
PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
```

:::info
* If you encounter the error `Eddy current sensor error`, increase the z_offset value in the eddy configuration, as shown in the example:

:::info
 * If the above operations are completed but bed scanning still fails, change the z limit to virtual limit.
