## Operation Instructions

    :::warning Attention

    * Please perform current calibration before coil frequency calibration
    * Multi-Z axis machines need manual leveling once after all calibrations are done, then level again, and recalibrate
    * The lower machine firmware must be completely consistent with the Kliiper version

    * Please perform current calibration before coil frequency calibration
    * Multi-Z axis machines need manual leveling once after all calibrations are done, then level again, and recalibrate
    * The lower machine firmware must be completely consistent with the Kliiper version

    :::


    * Please use the `FUIDD` webpage to add the following configuration before proceeding with the next operations
        ```cfg
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    ### Step Two: Calibrate EDDY Current

        * 1: Enter the following command in the console
            ```bash
            SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION z=80
            ```
        * 2: Home X and Y, move the toolhead to the center of the bed
            ```bash
            G28 X Y
            ```
        * After completing the above steps, calibrate the Eddy current. First, move Eddy to the center of the bed and then have the nozzle just touch the bed. Then execute the following command in the console to automatically obtain the current, finally `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters. A feedback value around 15 is normal; if feedback is 0 or 30, check if the connection is good (poor contact)
            ```bash
            LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * The normal return value should be around `15`
        * After calibration, `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters

    ### Step Two: Calibrate Eddy Frequency


        :::info

        * When installing Eddy, the eddy ocb board must be at least 1-2 mm higher than the nozzle
        * When calibrating Eddy frequency, the coil PCB should be at least 5mm away from the bed
        * This 5mm distance is to facilitate the next step of obtaining the `z_offset` with tissue paper

        :::

        * Then move the nozzle to the center of the platform (note: ensure the machine does not have a heightmap loaded)
        * Start manual z offset calibration [Paper Test](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test)
            ```bash
            PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
            ```
        * After calibration, `SAVE_CONFIG` to save the parameters
        :::info
        * For printers with `z_tilt` or `quad_gantry_level (QGL)` functionality, first adjust the parallelism (i3 adjust X-axis parallelism, trident adjust bed parallelism, voron 2.4 adjust gantry parallelism) then recalibrate Eddy frequency
        :::
    ### Step Three: Temperature Compensation
        * Step Three: Temperature compensation can only be started after successful homing

        * Home all axes
       ```bash
       G28
       ```

        * If there is `[quad_gantry_level]` or `[z_tilt]`, run `Z_TILT_ADJUST` or `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL` once, then home again
        * In the console, enter G0 Z5 or move the Z-axis to 5mm above the bed through the webpage
        * Execute the following code to set the machine's `idle timeout` longer to avoid timeout during the heating process
            ```bash
            SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=65000
            ```
        * Execute the following command to start calibration
            ```bash
            TEMPERATURE_PROBE_CALIBRATE PROBE=fly_eddy_probe TARGET=56 STEP=4
            ```
        :::warning Attention

        * Note: In the above command, the EDDy target temperature is set to `56℃`, suitable for most devices.
        * If the actual temperature of your 3D printer chamber is higher, you can appropriately increase the target temperature.
        * Please note, the higher the target temperature, the longer the calibration will take, as Eddy needs more time to reach temperature equilibrium.

        1. After executing this operation, the UI will display the Z-axis adjustment box. Please use the manual [Z offset calibration (Paper Test) method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) mentioned above, insert paper between the nozzle and the bed, and confirm this value.
        2. After accepting the value, set the bed temperature to its maximum and the nozzle temperature to 220℃.
        3. If you are in a room with air conditioning or open windows, to ensure Eddy's temperature rises, it is recommended to turn off the air conditioning or close the windows, as wind can affect temperature rise.
        4. As Eddy's temperature rises, the system will automatically prompt you to perform manual Z offset calibration every 4℃. The bed is very hot; be careful to avoid burns!!!
        5. Repeat manual Z offset calibration (Paper Test) until calibration is complete. If Eddy's temperature stops rising, you can use the following commands to end the calibration early.
        
        * Additional gcode commands available during drift calibration include: TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_NEXT`    Used to force Eddy to sample new data before reaching the set target temperature `56℃`.
            * `TEMPERATURE_PROBE_COMPLETE`    Used to complete calibration before Eddy reaches the set temperature `56℃`.
            * `ABORT`  Can be used to terminate calibration and ignore results.
        * After completing these steps, Eddy will be able to provide excellent first-layer print results across a wide temperature range!


## How to Fine-Tune Z-offset
* Step One: Slice a 200x200 square with a height of 0.2 using Prusa/OrcaSlicer/Cura/Bambu Studio to print and fine-tune z-offset
* Step Two: Enter the printer's IP to access `fluidd` `mainsail`, find the dashboard `move control` to continue fine-tuning Z-offset, then remember the fine-tuned value

* Step Three: Restart Klipper with the following command
```bash
FIRMWARE_RESTART
```
* Step Four: Adjust Z-offset through the UI interface that pops up with the following commands, the adjusted value is the value adjusted during printing
```bash
G28
PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
```

:::info
* If you encounter the error `Eddy current sensor error`, increase the z_offset value in the eddy configuration, see the example

:::info
 * If the above operations are completed but bed leveling fails, please change the z limit to virtual limit
