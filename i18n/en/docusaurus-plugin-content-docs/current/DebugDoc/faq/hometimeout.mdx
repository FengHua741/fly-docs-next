# Klipper Homing Timeout Issue

## Prompt

:::warning This prompt applies to all commands on this page
- If you receive an error message like `sed: can't read ~/klipper/klippy/mcu.py: No such file or directory` after executing a command
- Or any similar file not found errors (`No such file or directory`)
- Please confirm that Klipper is installed and the current user is the user who installed Klipper.
:::


## Error Description

- Error Message: `Error during homing z: Communication timeout during homing`

- The homing timeout issue mostly occurs during the Z-axis homing process in multi-mcu setups (X, Y also occur, but with lower probability).
- The reason is that Klipper has extremely strict real-time requirements. If Klipper does not receive a correct response from the mcu within `0.025 seconds`, it will consider the homing as a timeout.

## Solution

- The `0.025 seconds` in the Klipper code is too stringent and can be appropriately increased to solve the homing timeout issue.
- Execute the following command to directly modify the timeout time in the Klipper code to `0.05 seconds`.

    ```bash
    sed -i 's/TRSYNC_TIMEOUT = [0-9.]*$/TRSYNC_TIMEOUT = 0.05/' ~/klipper/klippy/mcu.py
    ```
    - If there is no output after executing the command, it means the modification was successful.

- After successfully modifying, you need to restart the Klipper service for the changes to take effect.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart klipper
    ```
    - If there is no output after executing the command, it means the restart was successful.

## Other Commands

- To view the timeout time in the Klipper code, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    grep "TRSYNC_TIMEOUT =" ~/klipper/klippy/mcu.py
    ```
    - It will normally output the following content (if the timeout time has been modified, it will output the modified time).

        ```bash
        TRSYNC_TIMEOUT = 0.025
        ```

- To revert the modified code, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    sed -i 's/TRSYNC_TIMEOUT = [0-9.]*$/TRSYNC_TIMEOUT = 0.025/' ~/klipper/klippy/mcu.py
    ```
    - If there is no output after executing the command, it means the modification was successful.
