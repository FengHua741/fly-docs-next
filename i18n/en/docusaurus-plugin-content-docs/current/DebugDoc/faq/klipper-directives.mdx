# Common Debugging Commands

    :::tip

    * This tutorial is mainly based on the Fuiidd web page.
    * This tutorial assumes that the printer is properly connected and ready for debugging.
    * This tutorial provides commonly used commands, but due to various issues, the collection may not be complete.

## Driver Related

    :::danger Note

    * Please note that faulty or unconfigured drivers cannot be checked.
    * Please ensure that all drivers are powered, motherboard is powered, and driver jumpers and configurations are correct!!

    :::


### Check Driver Status

    * This command verifies the TMC driver status in SPI/UART mode.
        ```bash
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_x
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_x1
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_y
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_y1
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z1
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z2
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=stepper_z3
        DUMP_TMC STEPPER=extruder
        ```

### Force Move Driver

    * Add the following command in `printer.cfg`.
        ```bash
        [force_move]
        enable_force_move: true
        ```

    * Command for forced back-and-forth movement of 1mm.
        ```bash
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_x
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_x1
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_y
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_y1
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z1
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z2
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=stepper_z3
        STEPPER_BUZZ STEPPER=extruder
        ```

    * By enabling this option, you can force move through the control interface.
    * Please note that only one motor can be moved at a time.
    * If there are multiple axes, such as two Z axes, they need to be homed before controlling.

### Force Set Print Head Distance

    * Enter the following command in the console to force set the print head position, after setting, it can be directly controlled to move.
        ```bash
        SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION x=100 y=100 z=100
        ```
### Stepper Motor Step Calibration
    * First, check if the extruder driver is working normally. Then, ensure that `full_steps_per_rotation` and `gear_ratio` are correct, otherwise, the extruder step calibration cannot be performed.
    * After obtaining the new `rotation_distance`, round it to three decimal places.
    * Step calibration: rotation_distance = old rotation_distance * actual extrusion length / requested extrusion length
    
        ```bash
        full_steps_per_rotation: 200        # Number of pulses per revolution (200 for 1.8 degrees, 400 for 0.9 degrees)
        gear_ratio: 50:10                   # Gear ratio (Galileo gear ratio 7.5:1 and this line is commented out; BMG is 50:17, output shaft first, input shaft second)
        rotation_distance: 22.522           # Pulley circumference in mm
        ```
## Heating Related

### PID
    :::tip
    * The `TARGET=` in the command is the set temperature, please set it to your usual printing temperature.
    * If you have multiple heating devices, you can use this command for PID tuning.
    :::

    * Extruder
        ```bash
        PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=245
        ```

    * Bed
        ```bash
        PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=100
        ```

    * PTC
        ```bash
        PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=PTC TARGET=70
        ```

### Temperature Error Related

    :::tip
    * If the heating takes too long, refer to this method <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/DebugDoc/ref-config/m109">click to jump</Button>.
    * Please note that if the temperature is unstable, you can use this method to solve the errors caused by unstable temperature <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/DebugDoc/ref-config/verify_heater">click to jump</Button>.

## Limit Switch Related

    :::tip
    * Currently being updated.
    :::

### Normal Limit Switch
    * Limit switch check command.
    * Ensure that the limit switch is two-wire. If it's three-wire, make sure the wiring sequence is correct, otherwise, it may damage the motherboard!!!
    * Ensure that the limit switch is in its normal open state and is not pressed by anything.
    * Enter the following command in the console, if everything is normal, it will return the following information.
        ```bash
        QUERY_ENDSTOPS
        ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/query.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * Ensure that all limit switches are in their open state, then manually press the limit switch and enter `QUERY_ENDSTOPS`.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/query1.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * If the limit switch status changes, it indicates that the wiring is correct.

### No Limit Switch
    * Please note that the no-limit switch status must be open, otherwise, there is an issue with the configuration or wiring.
    * Enter the following command in the console, if everything is normal, it will return the following information.
        ```bash
        QUERY_ENDSTOPS
        ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/query.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />

## Probe Related

### BL-TOUCH

    * pin_down: probe extends
    * pin_up: probe retracts
    * touch_mode: verify sensor
    ```bash
    BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=pin_down
    BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=pin_up
    BLTOUCH_DEBUG COMMAND=touch_mode
    ```

### Probe & TAP

    * Normally, it is not triggered.
    * It is recommended to add `^` when configuring the pin.
    ```bash
    QUERY_PROBE
    ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/faq/img/probe.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />

### Repeatability
    * Ten times
        ```bash
        probe_accuracy
        ```
    * One hundred times
        ```bash
        probe_accuracy samples=100
        ```

## Special Types

### Servo

    :::tip
    * Servos are divided into 180-degree and 360-degree types, please distinguish them carefully.
    :::

    * Reference configuration
        ```cfg
        [servo my_servo]
        pin:PE6
        ```

    * Reference command
        ```bash
        SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ANGLE=360
        SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ANGLE=180
        SET_SERVO SERVO=my_servo ANGLE=0
        ```
