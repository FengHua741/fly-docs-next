### Find
* Click on the main partition on the left, then click on the browse files above, and finally the files will appear below.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/home.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
* Find `home` and double-click to enter.
* Generally, there will be only one folder inside, and the name is your system user's name.
* If there are two or more, you need to determine yourself which one has your system configuration.
* Then double-click to enter.
* Find `printer_data`.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/printer-data.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
* The `printer_data` folder contains your print files, Klipper configuration, Klipper logs, etc., and can be exported directly.

### Export Configuration
* Right-click on `printer_data`, and a prompt will appear below.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/export.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
* Choose the directory where you want to save it or export it directly.
* Confirm the export.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/export1.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
* Open the exported file and find `config`. This is your system configuration.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/export2.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
* The configuration export is complete.
* Please note that the `moonraker` file should not be uploaded to other systems at will, as it may cause Klipper to fail to connect due to different systems.
