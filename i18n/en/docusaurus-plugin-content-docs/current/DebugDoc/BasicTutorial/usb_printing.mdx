# USB Drive Printing

This tutorial is only applicable to the FLY host machine.

    :::danger Note

    * You need to install it yourself.
    * This tutorial will replace the `klipper/klippy/extras/virtual_sdcard.py` file in Klipper.
    * It can automatically copy files from the selected USB drive to the system's `/tmp` directory.
    * After copying, it will prompt `File selected` in the web command line.
    * This file will detect the `sdaX` folder, and if it does not exist, it will not execute (where sdaX represents A-Z and 0-9).
    * Currently, only the FLY host machine has been tested; other host machines have not been tested.

    :::

## Usage Method



* Use SSH software to connect to the host machine and then execute the following command.
* Please note that this command will cause the host machine to restart!
* This step is to enable USB drive printing functionality.
    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /etc/udev/rules.d/fly_devices.rules && sudo wget https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/Utils/fly_devices.rules -O /etc/udev/rules.d/fly_devices.rules > /dev/null 2>&1 && sudo chmod +x /etc/udev/rules.d/fly_devices.rules && sudo service udev restart && sudo reboot
    ```

## USB Drive Printing Operation Method

### Backup and Download File

* Please note that this command will stop Klipper.
* This step is to enable the automatic copying of USB drive files to the system's `/tmp` directory when selecting a USB drive file.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop klipper && mv ~/klipper/klippy/extras/virtual_sdcard.py ~/virtual_sdcard.py && curl -kfsSL https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/firmware/virtual_sdcard.py -o ~/klipper/klippy/extras/virtual_sdcard.py && sudo systemctl restart klipper
    ```

### This step is to restore the original file

* Please note that this command is to restore the original Klipper.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop klipper && mv ~/virtual_sdcard.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/virtual_sdcard.py && sudo systemctl restart klipper
