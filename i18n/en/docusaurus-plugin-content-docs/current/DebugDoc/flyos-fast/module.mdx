# Introduction to Built-in System Components

:::danger

- All components and services built into the FlyOS-Fast system do not support user modifications or upgrades.
- Issues such as inability to access web pages or system startup failures may occur due to your modifications.
- Please re-flash the system.

:::

## Klipper

:::warning

- You can try adding third-party extras to the existing Klipper, but do not modify any of the existing extras modules.

:::

### Automatic Pause on Exception

- During printing, if Klipper encounters errors such as temperature anomalies or driver anomalies, it will automatically pause printing instead of shutting down directly.

### Real-time Optimization

- The real-time optimization of Klipper is achieved by modifying the kernel and Klipper code, optimizing the real-time performance of Klipper.
- Effectively reduces the `Timer too close` error.

### Support for Power Outage Continuation Printing and Exception Continuation Printing

- Supports power outage continuation printing.
- Supports error shutdown continuation printing.

### Support for TCP Sockets

- Supports enabling both Unix sockets and TCP sockets simultaneously.
- Use the -p parameter to specify the TCP port to enable TCP sockets.

### Automatic Handling of USB Drive Files

- Supports automatic handling of USB drive files to avoid print interruptions.

## Moonraker

### Support for TCP Sockets

- Supports connecting to klippy using TCP sockets.
- The `klippy_tcp_address` parameter specifies the TCP address.
- The `klippy_tcp_port` parameter specifies the TCP port.

### Optimization for Uploading Large Files

- Solves the problem of errors occurring when uploading large files consecutively.

### Network Management - Suitable for FLY5,7 Screens

- Supports wireless network management, suitable for FLY5,7 screens.

### Support for FLY Screens

- Supports FLY screens.
- Supports generating first-layer graphics for models.

## KlipperScreen

### Support for Power Outage Continuation Printing

- Supports power outage continuation printing.
- Automatically pops up a reminder window when detecting continuation printing.

## Fluidd

### Support for Power Outage Continuation Printing
