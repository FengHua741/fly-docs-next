# Power Loss Resume Function of Klipper

## Overview

- The power loss resume function of Klipper refers to the ability to automatically restore the printing status of Klipper after it is powered off and then powered on again.
- This function needs to be used in conjunction with the Safe Shutdown Module.
- It is not applicable for models where the Z-axis will move when the power is cut.

## Configuration

### plr.cfg Configuration File

- In the printer configuration page, click "New Configuration File" to create a `plr.cfg` file.
- The content of the configuration file is as follows:

    ```cfg
    [power_loss_resume]
    # power_pin: PA0 # The shutdown pin of the safe shutdown module connected to PA0 pin of the lower computer
    power_pin: host:gpiochip1/gpio21 # The shutdown pin of the safe shutdown module connected to PA21 pin of the upper computer
    is_shutdown: True # Whether to execute the shutdown operation, enabled by default
    paused_recover_z: -2.0 # If the machine is paused during shutdown, the Z movement distance when resuming print, no movement by default
    start_gcode:
        # G-code to be executed before resuming print
        # All parameters saved before power failure can be accessed via {PLR}
        # Available parameters can be output using M118 {PLR}
        M118 Start Resuming Print: {PLR.print_stats.filename}
        M118 Interrupt Position: X:[{PLR.POS_X}] Y:[{PLR.POS_Y}] Z:[{PLR.POS_Z}] E:[{PLR.POS_E}]
        M140 S{PLR.bed.target}      ; Set bed temperature
        M104 S{PLR.extruder.target-10}  ; Set extruder temperature
        M109 S{PLR.extruder.target-10}  ; Wait for extruder to reach set temperature
        G91                             ; Relative coordinates
        G1 Z2 F100                      ; Lift Z, prepare for X,Y homing
        G90                             ; Absolute coordinates
        G28 X Y                         ; Home XY
        M140 S{PLR.bed.target}          ; Set bed temperature
        M104 S{PLR.extruder.target}     ; Set extruder temperature
        M190 S{PLR.bed.target}          ; Wait for bed to reach set temperature
        M109 S{PLR.extruder.target}     ; Wait for extruder to reach set temperature
        M83                             ; Relative extrusion
        # G1 E0.5 F400                  ; Extrude a bit
    layer_count: 2 # Resume printing specified number of layers and execute layer_change_gcode
    layer_change_gcode:                
        # G-code to be executed after resuming {layer_count} layers
        M118 Resume Printing Speed
        M106 S{PLR.fan_speed}             ; Turn on the fan
        M220 S{PLR.move_speed_percent}    ; Set requested speed percentage
        M221 S{PLR.extrude_speed_percent} ; Set requested extrude speed percentage
    shutdown_gcode:
        # G-code to be executed before shutdown
        M118 Low Voltage, Shutdown
        # M112 ; Emergency stop

    ```

    :::warning Note

    - The `start_gcode` macro in the above configuration file may need to be modified according to the actual machine situation.

    :::

- After saving the above configuration file,
- Open the `printer.cfg` file and add the following content at the beginning of the file:

    ```cfg

    [include plr.cfg]

    ```

- Click the "Save" button on the top right and restart.
- The power loss resume function of Klipper has been configured.

## Testing

- Print any file, and click the "Emergency Stop" button during the print process to simulate a power failure.
- Click "Firmware Restart" again, wait for Klipper to connect normally.
- If a pop-up prompt appears on the web page or KlipperScreen, it indicates that the power loss resume function is working properly.
- You can continue to test the real power failure situation later.
