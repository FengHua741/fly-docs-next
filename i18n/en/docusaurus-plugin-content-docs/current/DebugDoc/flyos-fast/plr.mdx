# Klipper Power Loss Resume Function

- The Klipper power loss resume function refers to the ability of Klipper to automatically restore its printing status after being powered on again following a power outage.
- The FLY host, except for the C5 mainboard, requires the use of the KPPM power loss module in conjunction with other boards.
- Not applicable for models where the Z-axis will move after a power outage.
