# System Image Burning

## System Introduction
FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight Linux system customized for 3D printing, supporting the entire series of Fly mainboards. Its features include:

- Fast boot with kernel optimization ensuring Klipper real-time performance
- File system optimization reducing the risk of failure to boot due to power loss
- 30-second fast startup for KlipperScreen
- Pre-installed services including Klipper, RRF, Mainsail, Fluidd, Moonraker, and KlipperScreen
- Support for switching between Klipper and RRF systems
- Support for online one-click switching between Mainsail and Fluidd
- Support for USB printing, power-off resume printing, and serial console screen
- Support for automatic firmware burning (fly-c8, fly-geminiv3)
- Ability to pre-set default language and printer name for front-end UIs like Fluidd

For more OEM customization options (such as setting up custom boot logos, preset configuration files, hiding Mainsail tabs, etc.), please contact us.

:::tip Note
This is a lightweight customized system. The built-in components such as klipper are not official versions and do not support user modifications or upgrades.

## Preparation Before System Burning

1. Prepare the required devices

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="usb" label="If using a TF card to start the system, prepare the following devices" default>
        - Card reader
        - A TF card with a capacity of 16GB-128GB, with a transmission speed of Class10 or higher.
        - It is recommended to use high-quality TF cards from brands such as SanDisk, Samsung, and Kioxia; avoid using low-quality TF cards!
        - Windows PC (Windows 7, 10, or 11 is acceptable)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="can" label="If using M2WE to start the system, prepare the following devices">
        - M2WE (FLY proprietary device)
        - M2SD (FLY programming device)
        - Windows PC (Windows 7, 10, or 11 is acceptable)
        - Installation diagram

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


2. Download the FLY-{props.name} system image: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="https://g-ofpa1390.coding.net/public-artifacts/3D-Printers/flyos-fast/packages">{props.name} system image</Button>
    :::tip
    - The naming rule for system files is: `FlyOS-Fast-[chip series]-[version number].img`, for example: **FlyOS-Fast-{props.name}-v1.0.0.img**
    - For Windows systems, download the `.exe` file, which is a 7z self-extracting archive. After downloading, double-click to open and extract to get the `.img` file (this can only be done on Windows systems).
    - For other systems like MacOS and Linux, download the `.7z` file, which is a 7z compressed package. After downloading, use tools that support the 7z format to extract and get the `.img` file.
    - Due to the large size of the system files, other compression formats and source images are temporarily unavailable for download.
    - This tutorial will introduce the process using the `.exe` format as an example.
    :::
    - Access the FlyOS-Fast artifact repository, select the compression format, and enter the file page
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl1.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Select the image version (default is the latest)
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl2.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click `File List`, then click the scrollbar, drag it to the right, and the download button will appear
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl3.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click the download button to download the system image
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl4.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />


3. Extract the system image file to obtain the `.img` file.
    - Double-click or right-click to open **FlyOS-Fast-{props.name}.exe**, wait a few seconds, and a window will pop up (if the system prompts it is unsafe, select "More info" -> "Run").
    - You can choose the extraction directory, then click the `Extract` button, and wait for the extraction to complete.
    
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/ext1.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

    - After extraction, a **FlyOS-Fast-{props.name}-vx.x.x.img** file will be generated in the extraction directory. `x.x.x` is the system version number.


4. Install the device to be burned onto the computer


## Burn the System

1. Open Rufus, select the device, and ensure the displayed capacity matches the capacity of the burn card inserted into the computer.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

2. Choose the `Boot Type`, which defaults to selecting `Image File`.
3. Select the image file by clicking the `Select` button next to the `Boot Type Selection`, choosing the extracted `.img` file.
4. After selecting the image file, the `Boot Type Selection` will change to the filename of the image file.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash2.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

5. Click the `Start` button. If a pop-up window appears prompting you to clear disk data, click `OK`.
    
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash3.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />

6. After burning is complete, the computer will emit a prompt sound, and the progress bar will display `Ready`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash4.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

7. Do not rush to remove the burn card after completion.
8. Open File Explorer to check if there is a removable drive named `FlyOS-Conf`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash5.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

9. Open `FlyOS-Conf`. If the two files shown below exist, it indicates successful burning.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash6.webp').default} size="70%" align="center" />

10. Install the system card onto the motherboard.
