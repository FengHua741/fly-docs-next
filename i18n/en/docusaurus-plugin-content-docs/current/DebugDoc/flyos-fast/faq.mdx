# FlyOS-Fast Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Execution of the command prompts `command not found`
- **Cause**: The system does not have this command.

## Q: Why can't the `apt update` command be executed?
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight and fast system, without the apt package management tool, so the `apt update` command cannot be executed.
- **Solution**: The system has already pre-installed many commonly used software packages. If you need other packages, please submit them to us. If necessary, they will be pre-installed in the next version.

## Q: Execution of the burning command prompts `-bash: ~/klippy-env/bin/python: No such file or directory`
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast does not use venv virtual environment.
- **Solution**: Replace `~/klippy-env/bin/python` with `python` to execute it.

## Q: Why can't I log in as the `fly` user?
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast only has one root user, and all operations are performed under the root user.
- **Solution**: There is no `fly` user in the system. You can directly log in as `root`.

## Q: Why can't fly-tools on port 9999 be opened?
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast does not install fly-tools.
- **Solution**: fluidd and mainsail have both supported querying ID, and screen configuration is in [System Configuration](/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/config).

## Q: Why does the screen only display the LOGO and there is no KlipperScreen interface?
- **Cause**: KlipperScreen is not enabled.
- **Solution**: Enable KlipperScreen in [System Configuration](/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/config), set `klipper_screen` to `1`.

## Q: Why doesn't the system provide a web update for klipper components?
- **Cause**: The klipper, moonraker, and other components built into FlyOS-Fast are secondary development versions.
- **Solution**: If needed, you can update them yourself via the command line. However, it is not recommended. Wait for the system update instead.
