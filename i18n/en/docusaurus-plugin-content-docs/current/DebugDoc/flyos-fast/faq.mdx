# FlyOS-Fast Common Questions

## Q: Execution of the command prompts `command not found`
- **Cause**: The system does not have this command.
- **Solution**: The system has already built-in many commonly used software packages. If other packages are required, you can submit them to us. If necessary, they will be pre-installed in the next version.

## Q: Why can't the `apt update` command be executed?
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight and fast system, it does not have the apt package management tool, so the `apt update` command cannot be executed.
- **Solution**: The system has already built-in many commonly used software packages. If other packages are required, you can submit them to us. If necessary, they will be pre-installed in the next version.

## Q: Execution of the burning command prompts `-bash: ~/klippy-env/bin/python: No such file or directory`
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast does not use venv virtual environment.
- **Solution**: Replace `~/klippy-env/bin/python` with `python` for execution.

## Q: Why can't I log in as the `fly` user?
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast only has a root user, and all operations are performed under the root user.
- **Solution**: The system does not have a `fly` user, just log in directly as `root`.

## Q: Why can't fly-tools on port 9999 be opened?
- **Cause**: FlyOS-Fast does not install fly-tools.
- **Solution**: Both fluidd and mainsail have supported querying ID, and screen configurations are all in [System Configuration](/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/config).

## Q: Why does the screen only display the LOGO and not the KlipperScreen interface?
- **Cause**: KlipperScreen is not enabled.
- **Solution**: Enable KlipperScreen in [System Configuration](/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/config), set `klipper_screen` to `1`.

## Q: Why doesn't the system provide a web-based update for klipper components?
- **Cause**: The klipper, moonraker, and other components built into FlyOS-Fast are secondary development versions.
- **Solution**: If needed, you can update them yourself via the command line, but it is not recommended. Wait for the system update.

## Q: Why can't third-party component installation scripts like Happy Rabbit be used?
- **Cause**: The default user of FlyOS-Fast is `root`, and these third-party installation scripts all determine it as root and do not perform installation.
- **Solution**: It is only necessary to modify the root detection in the installation script, refer to [here](https://github.com/kluoyun/Happy-Hare/tree/flyos-dev), the other installation scripts are similar.
