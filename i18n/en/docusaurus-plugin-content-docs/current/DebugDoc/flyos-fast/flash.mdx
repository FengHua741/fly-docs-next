# System Image Burning

## Preparation

1. Complete the system download on the previous page [/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/](/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/).
2. Download the burning tool, this tutorial will use `Rufus` as an example. You can actually use other tools such as `Etcher`, `Win32 Disk Imager`, etc.
    - Rufus download link: [Click Download Chinese](https://rufus.ie/zh/#download) or [Click Download English](https://rufus.ie/en/#download) (only supports Windows).
    - Etcher download link: [Click Download](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) (supports Windows, MacOS, Linux).
    - Win32 Disk Imager download link: [Click Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) (only supports Windows).
3. Download the system image file, this tutorial will use `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe` as an example.

4. Extract the system image file to get the `.img` file.
    - Double-click or right-click to open `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe`, wait a few seconds and a window will pop up (if the system prompts that it is unsafe, select "More info" -> "Run").
    - You can choose the extraction directory, then click the `Extract` button, wait for the extraction to complete.

    - After extraction, a `FlyOS-Fast-H5-vx.x.x.img` file will be generated in the extraction directory. `x.x.x` is the system version number.
5. Prepare the burning card.
    - The burning card needs to be larger than 4GB, it is recommended to use a SanDisk 32GB C10 or higher TF card (testing found that many cheap cards cannot start after burning).
    - The burning card needs to be inserted into an SD card reader, insert the burning card into the reader, then insert the reader into the computer.

## Burn System

1. Open Rufus, select the device, the selected device should display capacity consistent with the burning card inserted into the computer.

2. Select `Boot selection type`, which defaults to `Image file`.
3. Select the image file, click the `Select` button on the right of `Boot selection type`, and select the extracted `.img` file.
4. After selecting the image file, the `Boot selection type` will change to the name of the image file.

7. Do not remove the burning card immediately after burning is complete.
8. Open File Explorer, check if there is a USB drive or removable disk named `FlyOS-Conf`.
