## System Image Filename Explanation

* System file naming rule: `FlyOS-Fast-[chip series]-[version number].img`, for example: `FlyOS-Fast-H5-v1.0.0.img`.
* The source file is in `.img` format. Only `.exe` and `.7z` compressed files are provided in the download link for convenience.
* Windows users should download the `.exe` file, which is a self-extracting 7z archive. After downloading, double-click it to extract and get the `.img` file (this can only be done on Windows).
* Users of other systems like MacOS or Linux should download the `.7z` file, which is a 7z archive. After downloading, use a tool that supports 7z format to extract and get the `.img` file.
* Due to the large size of the system files, other compression formats and source images are temporarily not available for download.

:::tip System Selection

* For fly-pi series, fly-c8 series, fly-gemini series, and all Fly products using the Allwinner H5 chip, choose `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe` or `FlyOS-Fast-H5.7z`.
* For fly-pi-lite2 series, fly-miniPad series, and all Fly products using the Allwinner H3 chip, choose `FlyOS-Fast-H3.exe` or `FlyOS-Fast-H3.7z`.
* Different chip models have different system files, please select according to your actual situation.
