## Precautions:

    * Ensure that the upper computer is powered off before installing the expansion board.
    * Avoid using the expansion board in a humid or dusty environment.
    * When installing the screen, please note not to plug and unplug while powered on, pay attention to the direction of the screen cable to avoid damage.
    * When installing the fan, please note the current and voltage specifications of the fan to avoid damage.
    * Please note that UART1 is already enabled by default and does not need to be configured.
    * Please flash the latest image such as `mainsailos`, not kernel upgrade.
    * **The Raspberry Pi can use all interfaces!!!**
    * **Note:** The system kernel version used by the Raspberry Pi must be greater than `5.17.x`, execute the command `uname -r` to view the kernel version.

### Introduction

    FLY-TFT-V2 is a TFT liquid crystal display based on st7796, supporting both capacitive and resistive touch screens, with a resolution of 320x480, using SPI interface

    * You need to install [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/) yourself.

### System Installation

:::warning Precautions
Note: The system kernel version used by the Raspberry Pi must be greater than `5.17.x`, execute the command `uname -r` to view the kernel version.
Please flash the latest image such as `mainsailos`, not kernel upgrade.
:::

* Use [Raspberry Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install the latest **MainsailOS**
    1. Download and install [Raspberry Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
    2. Open **Raspberry Imager**
    3. Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**
    4. Choose the corresponding model according to your device
    5. Click **CHOOSE OS**
    6. Select **Other specific-purpose OS**
    7. Select **3D printing**
    8. Select **Mainsail OS**
    9. Select the latest version. If your settings support 64-bit systems, select **rpi64**
    10. Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**
    11. Select your storage device, such as an SD card
    12. Click **NEXT**, wait for the installation to complete

### Driver Installation

    * Install FLY-TFT-V2 driver
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kluoyun/FLY-TFT.git
    cd FLY-TFT
    sudo chmod +x ./scripts/install.sh
    ./scripts/install.sh
    ```

### Enable TFT Display

    * Touch requires enabling I2C support, the corresponding configuration is `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`

    1. After installing the driver, add the overlay support `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2` to the config.txt file
    2. Open `/boot/config.txt` (for bookworm system it's `/boot/firmware/config.txt`)
        ```bash
        sudo nano /boot/config.txt
        ```
    3. Add the following configuration at the end of the file
    ```bash
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2
    ```
    * By default, the screen is displayed in landscape mode at 90 degrees. If you need to rotate the screen, use the following configuration
    ```bash
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r90  # Landscape orientation
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r270 # Landscape orientation (flipped)
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r0   # Portrait orientation
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r180 # Portrait orientation (flipped)
        ```
        * Only one configuration can be added, multiple configurations cannot be added
        * In normal cases, the touch direction of the TFT will automatically follow the display direction without modifying the touch configuration in the system
    4. After adding to the end of the file, execute the command `sudo reboot` to restart the system

### Use TFT

    * Make sure the hardware connection is correct
    * Installed drivers
    * Added `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2` overlay support in the `/boot/config.txt` (for bookworm system it's `/boot/firmware/config.txt`) file
    * Some systems may have a default fb0 device, FLY-TFT will be assigned to the fb1 device, you need to modify the configuration file to enable the fb1 device
    * Execute the command `ls /dev/fb*` to view the devices, if two devices fb0 and fb1 appear, please execute the following command to enable the fb1 device (by default it is fb0)
    * Execute the following command to modify the default configuration to the fb1 device
        ```bash
        sudo sed -i 's/\/dev\/fb0/\/dev\/fb1/g' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
        ```

### Use KlipperScreen

    * MainsailOS does not come with KlipperScreen installed by default, you need to install it manually
    * Refer to [KlipperScreen](https://github.com/KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen) or use [kiauh](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh) to install
    * If KlipperScreen is successfully installed and step 5 is correctly completed, the KlipperScreen interface should now be displayed

### All Available Configurations

    * `speed` [**requires parameter**]: Set the maximum SPI clock frequency of the TFT, unit is Hz, default is 96000000 (if severe screen artifacts occur, reduce this value appropriately)
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,speed=80000000`

    * `r0/r90/r180/r270` [**optional**][**no parameter required**]: Set the display and touch direction of the TFT, default is 90 degrees, selectable values are 0,90,180,270 (only one configuration can be added)
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r90` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r180`

    * `disable_touch` [**no parameter required**]: Disable the touch function of the TFT, disabled by default
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,disable_touch`

    * `invx`,`invy` [**no parameter required**]: Set the touch direction of the TFT, `invx` is X-axis flip, `invy` is Y-axis flip
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invx` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invy` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invx,invy`

    * `swapxy` [**no parameter required**]: Set the touch direction of the TFT, swap X-axis and Y-axis, i.e., landscape mode
        * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,swapxy`

    > **Note:** All parameters can be set simultaneously (optional parameters can only choose one), separate multiple parameters with commas, only one line can contain multiple parameters

    > **Warning:** Under normal circumstances, only the `r0`, `r90`, `r180`, `r270` four parameters are used, other parameters are only used in special cases, especially `invx`, `invy`, `swapxy`
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,speed=80000000,r270`
