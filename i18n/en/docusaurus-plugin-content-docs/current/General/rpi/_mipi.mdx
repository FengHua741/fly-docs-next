## Raspberry Pi 5 with MIPI

:::tip
FLY_MIPI is a special adapter module designed for the Raspberry Pi 5, which can be used directly to connect DSI and CSI devices through the adapter.

### Wiring for Raspberry Pi 5 with MIPI

    :::danger Notice

    * The DSI and CSI interfaces on the Raspberry Pi 5 are now called MIPI.
    * The MIPI interface can be configured to use CSI cameras or DSI screens directly.
    * Please pay attention to the direction of the gold fingers.

    :::

    * The Raspberry Pi 5 now has two MIPI interfaces. If you look from the front, you can see markings 1 and 0 above.

## Wiring for DSI Screen

    * If using the 1st interface, configure the screen as follows:

    ```bash
    dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-7inch,dsi1
    ```

    * If using the 0th interface, configure the screen as follows:

    ```bash
    dtoverlay=vc4-kms-dsi-7inch,dsi0
    ```
    * Reference wiring:
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/rpi/img/mipi_dsi.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />

## Wiring for CSI Camera

    * Please note that the camera model needs to be configured according to the one purchased. This tutorial uses imx219 as a reference.

    * If using the left MIPI interface, configure the camera as follows:
    ```bash
    dtoverlay=imx219,cam1
    ```

    * If using the right MIPI interface, configure the camera as follows:
    ```bash
    dtoverlay=imx219,cam0
    ```
    * Reference wiring:
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/rpi/img/mipi_csi.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
