# Flashing to M2WE via TF Card

:::info
System migration can completely transfer the image on the TF card to the M2WE, and after the migration is completed, the contents in M2WE remain consistent with those on the original TF card.
:::

    * After installing M2WE, power it on and boot
    * Please first connect to SSH using a serial port [by clicking here](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump")
    * Execute the following command; you may be prompted to enter a password. Input the password `mellow` and press Enter (note that the password is invisible)

    ```cfg
    sudo nand-sata-install
    ```

    * Select the option `Boot from eMMC - system on eMMC` and press Enter (generally the default option is selected, so just press Enter directly)

    * When prompted with `This script will erase your eMMC. Continue?`, select `Yes` and press Enter (generally the default option is selected, so just press Enter directly)

    * Select the file system type as `ext4` and press Enter (generally the default option is selected, so just press Enter directly)

    * Be patient until the progress bar appears (if no progress bar appears within 2 minutes, please press `CTRL+C` to terminate the operation, then restart the device and try again)

    * During the system migration process, do not disconnect power or perform other operations until the migration is complete
    * After the migration is complete, press Enter directly, and wait for the device to fully shut down

    * After shutdown, remove the TF card, power on again, and the system can now boot from the eMMC
