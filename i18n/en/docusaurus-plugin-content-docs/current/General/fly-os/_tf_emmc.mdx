# Flashing to M2WE via TF Card

:::info
System migration can fully migrate the image originally on the TF card to the M2WE. After the migration is complete, the contents in the M2WE remain consistent with those on the original TF card.
:::

    * Power on and start after installing the M2WE
    * Please first connect to SSH using serial port [Connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "Click to jump")
    * Execute the following command; you may be prompted to enter a password. Enter the password `mellow` and press Enter. Note that the password is not visible.

    ```cfg
    sudo nand-sata-install
    ```

    * Select the `Boot from eMMC - system on eMMC` option and press Enter (usually the default option is selected, so just press Enter)

    * During the system migration process, do not power off or perform other operations until the migration is complete
    * After the migration is complete, press Enter to wait for the device to fully shut down
