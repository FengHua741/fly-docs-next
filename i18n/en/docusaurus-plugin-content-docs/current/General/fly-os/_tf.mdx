# System Flashing TF Card

### Preparation Work

    * First install the software `SDFormatter` and `Rufus`
    <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ResDownload/auxiliary_software/">Formatting Tool</Button>
    * Extract the system, after extraction the file name has a suffix of `.img`
    * It is not recommended to use `balenaetcher` or `Raspberry Pi` for system flashing
    * Insert the TF card into the reader and plug the reader into the computer's USB interface
    * If the TF card has data please back up, after flashing the system it is not recommended to remove the system card, unless you need to flash it to M2WE before the TF card can be removed

### Formatting the Memory Card

    * Use the `SDFormatter.exe` software to format the TF card
    * Select the disk you want to format

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/fly-os/img/sdformatter.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />

    * Or delete the partition using the built-in Disk Management in WIN, after deleting the partition, just recreate the partition.
