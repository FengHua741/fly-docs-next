    <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="https://mellow.klipper.cn/docs/ResDownload/auxiliary_software/ÃŸ">Formatting Tool</Button>
    * Extract the system and the file name after extraction should have a `.img` suffix
    * It is not recommended to use `balenaetcher` or `Raspberry Pi` for system burning
    * Insert the SD card into the reader and plug the reader into the computer's USB interface
    * If the SD card has data, please back it up. After the system is burned, the system card is not recommended to be removed. You can only remove the SD card after it needs to be burned to M2WE and then removed

### Formatting Memory Card

    * Use the `SDFormatter.exe` software to format the SD card
    * Select the disk you want to format
