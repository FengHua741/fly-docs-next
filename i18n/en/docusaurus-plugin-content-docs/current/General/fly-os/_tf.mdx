# System Burn to TF Card

### Preparation

    * First install the `Win32DiskImager` software
    * Extract the system, the file name after extraction ends with `.img`
    * It is not recommended to use `balenaetcher` for system burning
    * Insert the TF card into the reader and plug the reader into the computer's USB port
    * If the TF card has data, please back it up. After burning the system, the system card is not recommended to be removed, unless you need to burn it to M2WE and then can remove the TF card

### Format Memory Card

    * Use the `TFFormatter.exe` software to format the TF card
    * Select the disk you need to format

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/fly-os/img/sdformatter.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />

    * Or use the built-in disk management in Windows to delete the partition, and then recreate the partition after deleting.
