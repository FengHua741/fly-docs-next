## Search for RS232 ID

### Precautions Before Searching for the Device

    * Before searching for the RS232 ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump")
    * Please note that you need to ensure that you are logging in to SSH via the network rather than through a serial port
    * Please ensure that UTOR is connected and that the data cable connecting to the host computer has data transfer capability
    * If using G2T, please determine whether the system supports UART connection

### Search for the Device

    * Now that you have successfully logged into the host computer, you can enter `lsusb` to search for devices. It will result in one of the following scenarios:
        * If entering `lsusb` prompts that the `ls` command cannot be found, you can enter the following command to install the command:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * If entering `lsusb` results in no reaction, this is a system issue and beyond our control. You will need to change the system or use a confirmed normal system
        * If the information shown below appears, please note that this is just a reference. You only need to confirm the characters after the ID.

    * `1a86:7523` belongs to the device you need to use. The subsequent prompt does not need to be managed as the system issue may cause it to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If not, please check if the data cable is properly connected and if the firmware has been correctly flashed.

    :::warning Precautions

    You can only use the following command to search for the RS232 ID when there is `1a86:7523`.

### Search for RS232 ID

    ```bash
    ls /dev/serial/by-path/*
    ```

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/rs232-id.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
    * If there is no ID output after entering `ls /dev/serial/by-path/*`, but `lsusb` shows a device, please replace the host computer or the host computer system
    * Please note that UTOR will output three IDs, and if you have used another UTOR system, it will record it and cause multiple IDs to appear during the search
    * Please ensure that the ID ends with `-port0` otherwise it cannot be used.

    :::warning Precautions

    Please make sure that the tool board and UTOR are grounded!!! Otherwise, you cannot connect to the tool board!!!

### Fill in the RS232 ID into the Configuration

    * Open the printer web interface, find `printer.cfg` under the configuration option on the left sidebar; for fluidd it is `{...}`, and for mainsail it is `machine`, click in to find `printer.cfg`

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />

    * Copy the blue ID and fill it into the `serial:` field in the `[mcu SHT36]` section of the `printer.cfg` configuration. After saving and restarting, you can connect to the mainboard. If Klipper prompts ``ADC out of range``, it is a normal phenomenon. Connect the hot bed and thermistor well, configure the thermistor pins and output pins for the nozzle and hot bed, then save and restart.

    :::warning Precautions

    * The RS232 ID needs to configure `baud:` and `restart_method:command`
    * Below is a reference configuration

    :::

        ```cfg
        [mcu SHT36]
        serial: /dev/serial/by-path/platform-1c1c000.usb-usb-0:1.2:1.0-port0
        baud: 250000
        restart_method:command
        ```

    :::danger

    Note: All IDs appearing in the document are examples. Each mainboard's ID is different, so please modify and fill in according to the actual obtained ID.

    :::

    :::danger

    Please note that the following ID cannot be used!!!!

    :::

        ```cfg
        serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
        ```
