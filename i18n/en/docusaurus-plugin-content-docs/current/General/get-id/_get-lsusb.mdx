## Precautions Before Searching for Devices

    * Before obtaining the ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump").
    * Please ensure that the data cable connecting the lower computer to the upper computer has data transfer capabilities.
    * After connecting to the upper computer via SSH, input `lsusb` and press Enter. Several devices may appear.
    * If the system does not support `lsusb`, you can execute the following command to install it.
    * If no devices appear after `lsusb`, please replace the upper computer!
    ```
    sudo apt-get install usbutils
    ```

    * Please confirm whether the motherboard firmware has been flashed with the correct firmware.
    * If it is a USB firmware, `1d50:614e` should appear after `lsusb`.
    * If it is a USB bridge CAN firmware, `1d50:606f` should appear after `lsusb`.
    * If it is an RS232 firmware, UTOR or G2T must be used in conjunction. G2T does not require firmware searching, while UTOR should appear as `1a86:7523` after `lsusb`.

## Precautions During Searching for Devices

:::danger Notice
The search ID command cannot be mixed!!!
:::

    * Please note that USB firmware can only use the USB ID search method.
    * Please note that USB bridge CAN firmware can only use the CAN ID search method.
    * Please note that RS232 firmware can only use the RS232 ID search method.
    * If `0483:df11` appears, it may indicate that the firmware has been flashed but the motherboard was not powered off and restarted. If the issue persists after powering off and restarting the motherboard, check if DFU (jumper/dip switch/button) has been disconnected.
    * If `2e8a:0003` appears, it may indicate that the wrong firmware has been flashed. Note that RP2040 can only flash UF2 firmware compiled from source code; other firmware cannot be flashed. After `2e8a:0003` appears, disconnect BOOT (jumper/dip switch/button) to avoid flashing failure!!!
    * The UF2 firmware for RP2040 is compiled with `No bootloader` option to generate the UF2 firmware.
