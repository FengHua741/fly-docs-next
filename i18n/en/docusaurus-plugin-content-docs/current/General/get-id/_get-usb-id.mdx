## Search USB Tutorial

## Precautions Before Searching for Devices

    * Please connect to SSH before searching for the USB ID ([Connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "Click to jump"))
    * Note that you must log in to SSH via the network rather than via serial port
    * Ensure that the mainboard with the flashed USB firmware is properly connected and that the data cable connecting it to the host computer has data transfer capability

## Search for Devices
    * Ensure that the host computer can access the internet normally and that the data cable connecting the peripheral device to the host computer has data transfer capability.
    * After connecting to the host computer via SSH, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the following image appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback, this indicates a problem with the host computer's system, and we are unable to assist; you need to replace the system with one that is confirmed to be working or replace the host computer.
        * If the instruction `lsusb` is not found, you can execute the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * `1d50:6177` is the device you will be using for this task. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f407xx` is somewhat indicative but should not be used as a basis for judgment.
        * Some host computers may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
        * If the `lsusb` command displays the device but does not show `1d50:6177`, try changing the data cable and connecting the mainboard to another USB port on the host computer.
    * If you have previously executed the above steps and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the mainboard is running normally, but you just want to update the Klipper firmware, refer directly to the `Firmware Update` section in the right-hand menu of this page.

    :::warning Precautions
       You must query the `1d50:6177` device before proceeding to the next step.

## Search for USBID

    ```bash
    ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
    ```

    * Enter the command below and press Enter. If everything is normal, a blue ID will appear. (The ID below is for reference only)
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/usb-id.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />
    * If no ID appears after entering the command below, but `lsusb` shows devices, please replace the host computer or change the host computer system

:::warning Precautions
If multiple IDs appear, select the appropriate ID based on your mainboard's **MCU** model.

### Fill in the USB ID into the Configuration

    * Open the printer web interface, find `printer.cfg` under the configuration options in the left sidebar: fluidd is `{...}`, mainsail is `Machine`, click to enter.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />

    * Copy the blue ID and paste it into the `serial:` field under the `[mcu]` section in the `printer.cfg` configuration file. After saving and restarting, the mainboard should be connected. If Klipper prompts `ADC out of range`, this is a normal phenomenon; connect the heated bed and thermistor properly, configure the thermistor and output pins for the nozzle and heated bed, then save and restart.

:::danger
Note: All IDs mentioned in the document are examples. Each mainboard's ID is different, so modify and fill in according to the actual ID obtained.
