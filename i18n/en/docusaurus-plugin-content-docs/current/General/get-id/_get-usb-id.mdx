## Precautions before searching for devices

    * Before searching for the USB ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "Click to jump")
    * Please note that it is necessary to ensure that the SSH is logged in using the network rather than the serial port.
    * Please ensure that the motherboard with the USB firmware flashed is connected, and ensure that the data cable connecting the upper computer has a data transmission function.

## Search for devices
    * Please ensure that the upper computer can be connected to the network normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the lower computer to the upper computer has a data transmission function.
    * After connecting to the upper computer via SSH, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no information feedback, this is a system problem of the upper computer, and we are powerless. You need to replace the system with a confirmed normal one or replace the upper computer.
        * If the `lsusb` command is not found, you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * `1d50:6177` is the device you need to use this time. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f407xx` has a certain reference value, but it is not used as a judgment basis.
        * Some upper computers may have incomplete or no display due to system problems.
        * If the `lsusb` command can display the device, but there is no `1d50:6177`, please try to change the data cable and try to connect the motherboard to other USB ports of the upper computer.
    * If you have previously performed the above steps and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the motherboard is operating normally, but only need to update the Klipper firmware, please directly view the `Firmware Update` chapter in the right sidebar of this page.

    :::warning Precautions
       The next step can only be performed after the `1d50:6177` device is found.

## Search for USBID

    ```bash
    ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
    ```

    * Enter the following command and press Enter. If everything is normal, a blue ID will appear in the following line. (The following is just for reference)
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/usb-id.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />
    * If there is no ID after entering the following command, but there is a device in `lsusb`, please replace the upper computer or the upper computer system.


:::warning Precautions
If multiple IDs appear, please select the corresponding ID according to the **MCU** model of your motherboard.

### Fill in the USB ID in the configuration

    * Open the printer web interface, find in the configuration options on the left sidebar: for fluidd: `{â€¦}`; for mainsail: `Machine`, click to enter, and you can find `printer.cfg`.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />

    * Copy the blue ID and fill it in the `serial: ` of the `[mcu]` node in the `printer.cfg` configuration. After saving and restarting, the motherboard can be connected. If Klipper prompts ``ADC out of range``, it is a normal phenomenon. Connect the heated bed and the thermistor, configure the thermistor pins and output pins of the nozzle and the heated bed, and then save and restart.

Note: All IDs appearing in the document are examples. The actual ID of each motherboard is different. Please modify and fill in according to the ID actually obtained.
