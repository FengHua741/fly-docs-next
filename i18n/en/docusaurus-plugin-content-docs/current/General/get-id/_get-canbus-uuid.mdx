## CAN Configuration and ID Search

* If you need to use CAN, please confirm that your host computer has performed CAN configuration.

---

:::danger Notice

Please ensure the motherboard is connected to the host computer before performing the following operations.

:::


:::warning

Please make sure the CAN network of the host computer, the CAN rate of the bridge motherboard, and the rate of the CAN tool board are completely consistent.

:::

### Precautions Before Device Search

    * Before searching for the CAN ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump").
    * Please note that it is necessary to ensure that the network login is used to SSH instead of serial port login.
    * Please ensure that the UTOC is connected or the CAN bridge firmware is flashed on the motherboard, and ensure that the data cable connecting the host computer has data transmission capability.

### Device Search

    * Now that you have successfully logged into the host computer, you can enter `lsusb` to search for devices, which will result in one of the following scenarios:
        * If entering `lsusb` prompts that the `ls` command is not found, you can enter the following command to install the command:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * If entering `lsusb` results in no response, this indicates a system issue, and we cannot help. You need to replace the system or use a confirmed normal system.
        * If the information shown in the image below appears, please note that this is just a reference. You only need to confirm that `1d50:606f` appears.
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/606f.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
    * `1d50:606f` belongs to the device you need to use. The subsequent prompts do not need to be concerned about, as system issues may cause them to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If there are multiple `1d50:606f`, it is recommended to exclude one, otherwise it will affect the subsequent burning and firmware connection. For example, if it is `FLY MINI PAD`, it is recommended to use the onboard UTOC and not other CAN bridge devices.
    * If none appear, please check whether the data cable is properly connected and whether the firmware has been correctly flashed.

:::warning Notice
You can only proceed with CAN ID search when `1d50:606f` appears.

### CAN ID Search

    * Enter the following command to search for the ID:
    ```bash
    ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```
    * If an ID appears and the `Application:` at the end shows `Klipper`, it means this ID can be used directly.
    * If an ID appears and the `Application:` at the end shows `CANBOOT` or `Katapult`, it means the firmware needs to be flashed before it can be used.

### CAN Problem Collection

    :::danger Notice

    * If you cannot find the CAN ID, see the document below.

### Fill in the CAN ID into the Configuration

    * Open the printer web interface, find `printer.cfg` in the configuration options on the left sidebar. For fluidd, it is `{...}`; for mainsail, it is `Machine`. Click to enter and locate `printer.cfg`.

    * Copy the queried UUID and fill it into the `canbus_uuid:` field under the `[mcu]` node in the `printer.cfg` configuration. After saving and restarting, the mainboard can be connected. If Klipper prompts that the firmware needs to be updated or reports errors such as ADC, it indicates that Klipper has connected to the mainboard.
    * If the `Application:` displays Canboot, it cannot be configured into the configuration file. You need to flash the Klipper firmware before proceeding.

        :::danger

        Note: All IDs mentioned in the documentation are examples. Each mainboard's ID is different. Please modify and fill in according to the actual obtained ID.

        :::

    * Below is a reference configuration:
        :::danger

        * This is a reference configuration method for one mainboard and one tool board.
        * If it is the mainboard ID, it must be `[mcu]` plus `canbus_uuid:` followed by the ID you searched for.
        * If it is the tool board, it must be `[mcu tool board name]` plus `canbus_uuid:` followed by the ID you searched for.
