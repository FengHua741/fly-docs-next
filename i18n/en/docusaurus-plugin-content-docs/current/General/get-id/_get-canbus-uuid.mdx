## CAN Configuration and ID Search

* If you need to use CAN, make sure your host machine has performed CAN configuration.

---

:::danger Note

Please ensure the mainboard is connected to the host machine before performing the following operations.

:::


:::warning

Ensure the host machine's CAN network, the CAN rate of the bridge mainboard, and the CAN tool board's rate are all completely consistent.

:::

### Precautions Before Device Search

    * Before searching for the CAN ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump").
    * Please note that you must log in to SSH via the network rather than via a serial port.
    * Ensure that the UTOC is connected or the mainboard with CAN bridge firmware is flashed, and ensure that the data cable connecting to the host machine has data transmission capability.

### Device Search

    * Now that you have successfully logged into the host machine, you can enter `lsusb` to search for devices, which will result in one of the following scenarios:
        * If entering `lsusb` prompts that the `ls` command is not found, you can enter the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * If entering `lsusb` results in no response at all, this indicates a system issue, and we cannot help here. You need to replace the system or use a confirmed normal system.
        * If the information shown in the image below appears, please note that this is just a reference. You only need to confirm that `1d50:606f` appears.
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/606f.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
    * `1d50:606f` belongs to the device you will be using this time.
    * If there are multiple `1d50:606f`, it is recommended to exclude one to avoid affecting subsequent firmware burning and connection, such as if it is a `FLY MINI PAD`, then it is recommended to use the onboard UTOC instead of other CAN bridge devices.
    * If none appear, please check whether the data cable is properly connected and whether the firmware is correctly flashed.

:::warning Note
You can only search for CAN IDs when there is `1d50:606f`.

:::

### Search CAN ID

    * Enter the following command to search for the ID:
    ```bash
    ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```
    * If an ID appears and the final `Application:` shows `Klipper`, it means this ID can be used directly.
    * If an ID appears and the final `Application:` shows `CANBOOT` or `Katapult`, it means the firmware needs to be flashed before it can be used.

### CAN Problem Collection

    :::danger Note

    * If the CAN ID cannot be found, refer to the documentation below.

### Fill the CAN ID into the Configuration

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        - For fluidd: `{â€¦}`, click to find `printer.cfg`
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
      </td>
      <td>
        - For mainsail: `Machine`, click to find `printer.cfg`
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/mainsail-cfg.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>


    * Copy the queried UUID and fill it into the `[mcu]` node in the `printer.cfg` configuration under `canbus_uuid:`. After saving and restarting, the mainboard will connect. If Klipper prompts that the firmware needs to be updated or ADC errors occur, it means Klipper has connected to the mainboard.
    * If `Application:` shows Canboot, it cannot be configured in the configuration file. You need to flash the Klipper firmware before proceeding.

        :::danger

        Note: All IDs mentioned in the document are examples; each mainboard's ID is different. Please modify and fill in according to the actual obtained ID.

        :::

    * Below is a reference configuration:
        :::danger
        ```
        [mcu]
        canbus_uuid: <replace with the ID you just queried>
        ```
        * The following is a reference method for MCU ID configuration when there is one mainboard and one tool board.
        * If it is the mainboard ID, it must be `[mcu]` plus `canbus_uuid:` followed by the ID you searched for.
        * If it is a tool board, it must be `[mcu tool board name]` plus `canbus_uuid:` followed by the ID you searched for.
