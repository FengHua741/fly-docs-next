    * When installing the programming plugin, you need to be connected to the internet. Please ensure that your host computer is already properly connected to the Internet.
    * If it has been installed, there is no need to install it again.

### Start Programming

:::warning Warning
* For **non-fly host computers**, please make sure to execute the following code to install the dependency package for firmware programming! Otherwise, the firmware cannot be programmed!
    ```
      cd && git clone https://github.com/Arksine/katapult.git
    ```
* Use this command to install in China
```
  cd && git clone https://gitee.com/MrCakeFuck/katapult.git
```

:::
    * Use the following instruction to search for your device ID, and the ID shown in the figure below should appear (note: the ID shown in the figure is for reference only, and each motherboard has a different ID):

        ```bash
        ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
        ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/2040.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />


    * To program the firmware, use the following code, and make sure the firmware has been compiled successfully. *Please replace `<your motherboard ID>` with the ID queried in the previous step.*

        ```bash
        ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py -d /dev/serial/by-id/<your motherboard ID>
        ```
    For the `fast` system, use this command to program, *please replace `<your motherboard ID>` with the ID queried in the previous step.*
    
     ```bash
    python ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py -d /dev/serial/by-id/<your motherboard ID>

     ```

    * Use the following instruction to search for your motherboard ID, and the ID shown in the figure below should appear (note: the ID shown in the figure is for reference only, and each motherboard has a different ID).

        ```bash
        ls /dev/serial/by-id/*

    :::tip Note
        In the figure below, `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_rp2040_E662549553642032-if00` is the motherboard's ID.

## Solution for Incorrect Firmware Burning

* Power off the motherboard, power on again, and quickly double-click the reset button to re-enter programming mode.
* Or use the window/host machine to re-burn the katapult firmware <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-d5/flash/bl#enter_dfu_programming_mode">burn katapult firmware</Button>
