1. Install the burning tool

    * Enter the following command in SSH
    * Only execute this the first time you burn, no need to execute it afterwards
    ```bash
    cd ~/klipper/lib/rp2040_flash/ && make
    ```
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/2040.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />

2. Execute the following command to check if the connection is successful.


    * Enter `lsusb`
    * If there is no `2e8a:0003` device, please try to re-enter **burning mode**
    * Due to system version issues, it may show other names. If there is `2e8a:0003`, it indicates that the burning mode has been entered.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/2e8a.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 

    :::warning Notice

3. Pull the pre-compiled firmware

    * These are all pre-compiled firmwares
    * Please note that the host machine needs to be able to access the internet to install
    * The host machine needs to execute the following command to download the firmware package

    ```bash
    cd && git clone https://github.com/FengHua741/FLY_Katapult.git
    ```

    * If the firmware package has already been downloaded, it is recommended to update the firmware package before proceeding with the remaining operations

    ```
