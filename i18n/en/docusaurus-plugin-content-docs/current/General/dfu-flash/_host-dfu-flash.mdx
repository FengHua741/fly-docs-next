    1. Install the burning tool

    * No need to execute the installation of the burning tool for the FLY upper computer
    * If you need to install, please note: The upper computer needs to be able to access the internet to install normally
    * If already installed, no need to install

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install dfu-util -y
    ```

    2. Execute the following command to check if the connection is successful.

    ```bash
    lsusb
    ```

    * If there is no DFU device, please try to re-enter **burning mode**
    * Due to system version issues, it may display other names. If `0483:df11` is shown, it indicates entering burning mode
