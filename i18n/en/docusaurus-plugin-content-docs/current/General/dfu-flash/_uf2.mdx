* Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the peripheral machine to the host machine has data transmission function.
* After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the following image is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no feedback information, this indicates a system issue with the host machine, and we are unable to help. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
    * If the prompt says there is no `lsusb` command, you can execute the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `2e8a:0003` belongs to the device you will be using this time. The suffix `Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot` has some reference value but is not used as a basis for judgment.
    * Some host machines may display incompletely or not at all due to system issues.
    * If entering the `lsusb` command displays the device but does not show `2e8a:0003`, please try replacing the data cable and attempt to connect the motherboard to another USB port on the host machine.

:::warning Note
You can only proceed to the next step when there is `2e8a:0003`.
