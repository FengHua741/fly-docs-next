* Please ensure that the upper computer can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the lower computer to the upper computer has a data transmission function.
* After SSH connection to the upper computer, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the picture below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no information feedback, this is a system problem of the upper computer. We can do nothing about it. You need to replace the system that is determined to be normal or replace the upper computer.
    * If it is prompted that there is no `lsusb` instruction, you can execute this command to install
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:6177` belongs to the device you will use this time. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f407xx` has a certain reference value, but it is not used as a judgment basis.
    * Some upper computers may not display completely or not display at all due to system problems.
    * If the device can be displayed when the `lsusb` instruction is entered, but there is no `1d50:6177`, please try to replace the data cable and try to connect the motherboard to other USB ports of the upper computer.
* If you have previously performed the above steps and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the motherboard is operating normally, but only need to update the Klipper firmware, please directly check the `Firmware Update` chapter in the menu bar on the right side of this page.

:::warning Precautions
   The next step can only be carried out after the `1d50:6177` device is found.
