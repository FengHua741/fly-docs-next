* Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally and ensure that the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transmission function.
* After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the following picture appears, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no feedback at all, this is a system problem of the host machine, and we are unable to help. You need to replace with a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
    * If the prompt says there is no `lsusb` command, you can execute the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:6177` belongs to the device you will use this time.
    * Some host machines may not fully display or fail to display due to system problems.
    * If the `lsusb` command can display the device but does not show `1d50:6177`, please try replacing the data cable and connecting the mainboard to another USB port on the host machine.
* If you have executed the above steps before and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the mainboard is running normally, but you just want to update the Klipper firmware, please directly check the `Firmware Update` section in the right menu bar of this page.

:::warning Notice
   You must query the `1d50:6177` device before proceeding to the next step.
