* Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the sub-machine to the host machine has data transmission capabilities.
* After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no feedback information, this indicates a system problem with the host machine, and we are unable to assist. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
    * If the prompt says there is no `lsusb` command, you can execute the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:6177` belongs to the device you will be using this time. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f407xx` has some reference value but is not used as a basis for judgment.
    * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system problems.
    * If entering the `lsusb` command displays the device but does not show `1d50:6177`, please try replacing the data cable and attempt to connect the motherboard to another USB port on the host machine.
* If you have executed the above steps previously and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the motherboard is running normally, but you just need to update the Klipper firmware, please directly refer to the `Firmware Update` section in the right-hand menu bar of this page.

:::warning Note
   You must query the `1d50:6177` device before proceeding to the next step.
