### Preparation

    * Before starting to burn the firmware, please first [connect via SSH using the network connection](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "Click to jump")
    * Counterfeit memory cards may cause the burning process to fail. Please try to use the recommended memory card below for firmware updates
    * Prepare a TF card with a capacity of no more than `32G`, and it is recommended that the transmission speed of the TF card must be `class10` or higher. It is recommended to use brands such as SanDisk for the TF card

### Download Firmware

    1. Use the previously prepared TF card
    2. Format using `SDFormatter`

    3. Using **MobaXterm_Personal**, find `klipper` in the left file directory, then find `out` and open it

    4. And download `klipper.bin` to the TF card, and rename it to `firmware.bin`

    5. Power off the motherboard, insert the TF card into the motherboard
    6. On the motherboard, wait for 10 seconds
    7. Remove the TF card, insert it into the computer. If the `firmware.bin` in the SD card disappears and `FLY.CUR` appears, it indicates that the burning was successful
