* Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally.
* Please ensure that the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transfer functionality.
* After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press enter. The following three scenarios may occur:
    * It will display the recognized USB devices.
    * It will prompt that there is no `ls` command; you can execute this command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```
    * There is no error message, but also no other information (a system issue requires replacing the system).
* If there is no reaction after entering `lsusb`, this is a system issue, and we are unable to help; you need to replace with a confirmed normal system.
* If the information circled in the following image appears, you can proceed to the next step.

* `0843:df11` belongs to the device you will be using this time. You do not need to worry about the subsequent prompts as they may not fully display or may not display at all due to system issues.
* If not, please check whether the data cable is properly connected or if the motherboard has entered DFU mode.

:::warning Note

Proceed to the next step only if there is `0843:df11`.
