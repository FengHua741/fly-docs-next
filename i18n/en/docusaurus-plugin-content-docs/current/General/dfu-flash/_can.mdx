* Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the sub-machine to the host machine has data transmission capabilities.
* After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the following image appears, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no feedback information, this is a system issue with the host machine, and we are unable to help. You need to replace it with a normal system or replace the host machine.
    * If there is a提示 of no `lsusb` command, you can execute the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:606f` belongs to the device you will be using this time. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. Geschwister Schneider CAN adapter` has some reference value but is not used as a basis for judgment.
    * Some host machines may display incompletely or not at all due to system issues.
    * If entering the `lsusb` command displays the device, but does not show `1d50:606f`, please try replacing the data cable and attempt to connect the motherboard to another USB port on the host machine.
* If you have executed the above steps previously and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the motherboard is operating normally, but you only need to update the Klipper firmware, please directly refer to the `Firmware Update` section in the right-hand menu bar of this page.

:::warning Note

You can only proceed to the next step when there is `1d50:606f`.
