    * Please ensure that the host computer can access the Internet normally and ensure that the data cable connecting the lower computer to the host computer has data transmission function.
    * After SSH connecting to the host computer, input `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the picture below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback information, this is a system problem of the host computer, and we are powerless. You need to replace a confirmed normal system or replace the host computer.
        * If there is no `lsusb` command prompt, you can execute the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
