* Please ensure that the host computer can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the lower computer to the host computer has a data transmission function.
* After SSH connection to the host computer, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no information feedback, this is a system problem of the host computer. We are powerless in this regard. You need to replace the system with a confirmed normal one or replace the host computer.
    * If the `lsusb` command is not available, you can execute this command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:6177` belongs to the device you will use this time. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f407xx` has a certain reference value, but it is not used as a judgment basis.
    * Some host computers may not display the information completely or not display it at all due to system problems.
    * If the device can be displayed when the `lsusb` command is entered, but `1d50:6177` is not present, please try to replace the data cable and try to connect the motherboard to other USB ports of the host computer.
* If you have previously performed the above steps and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the motherboard is operating normally, but only need to update the Klipper firmware, please directly view the `Firmware Update` chapter in the menu bar on the right side of this page.

:::warning Precautions

The next step can be performed only when `1d50:6177` is present.
