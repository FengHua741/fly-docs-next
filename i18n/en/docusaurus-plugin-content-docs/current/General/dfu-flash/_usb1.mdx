* Please ensure that the host computer can connect to the network normally and ensure that the data cable connecting the slave computer to the host computer has data transmission function.
* After SSH connecting to the host computer, input `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the picture below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no feedback at all, this is a system problem of the host computer. We are unable to help. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or replace the host computer.
    * If there is no `lsusb` command prompt, you can execute the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:614e` belongs to the device you will use this time.
    * Some host computers may not display fully or fail to display due to system problems.
    * If the device can be displayed after entering the `lsusb` command but without `1d50:614e`, please try replacing the data cable and connecting the mainboard to another USB port on the host computer.
* If you have executed the above steps before and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the mainboard is running normally, but you only want to update the Klipper firmware, please directly refer to the `Firmware Update` section in the right menu bar of this page.

:::warning Note
   You must query one of the `1d50:614e` devices before proceeding to the next step.
