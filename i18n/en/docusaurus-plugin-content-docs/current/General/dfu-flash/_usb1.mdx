* Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally and ensure that the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transmission function.
* After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
    * If there is no feedback information, this is a system problem of the host machine, and we are unable to help. You need to replace a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
    * If there is a prompt saying that the `lsusb` command does not exist, you can execute the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```

* `1d50:614e` belongs to the device you will use this time. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. stm32f407xx` has certain reference value but is not used as a basis for judgment.
    * Some host machines may display incompletely or not at all due to system problems.
    * If the device can be displayed by entering the `lsusb` command, but without `1d50:614e`, please try replacing the data cable and connecting the motherboard to another USB port on the host machine.
* If you have executed the above steps before and successfully burned the Klipper firmware, and the motherboard is running normally, and you just want to update the Klipper firmware, please directly refer to the `Firmware Update` section in the right-hand menu bar of this page.

:::warning Note
   You must query one of the `1d50:614e` devices before proceeding to the next step.
