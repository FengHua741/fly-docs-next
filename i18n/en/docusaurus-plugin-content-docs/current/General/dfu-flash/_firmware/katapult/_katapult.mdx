Katapult was originally named CanBoot, and later renamed to katapult.

:::

* Katapult firmware is a type of bootloader that can be used in conjunction with Klipper. After burning the firmware using methods like DFU, you can use commands to update the firmware with one click.
* Advantage: Quickly double-clicking the reset button or quickly cutting power twice will enter the Katapult firmware, at which point there will be an LED flashing on the mainboard.
* Katapult firmware can only be used to burn firmware and cannot connect to Klipper!!!
* Katapult firmware supports three connection methods for connecting to the host computer, and the firmwares for these three methods are independent of each other.
    * CAN connection
        * Advantage: After compiling the KLIPPER firmware, you can directly update the firmware using a command, and it has strong interference resistance.
        * Disadvantage: You need to know the firmware compilation rate in advance.
    * RS232 connection
        * Advantage: After compiling the KLIPPER firmware, you can update the firmware using a command, and it has very strong interference resistance.
        * Disadvantage: You cannot use a command to update the firmware with one click; you need to manually enter the Katapult firmware.
    * USB connection
        * Advantage: After compiling the KLIPPER firmware, you can directly update the firmware using a command.
        * Disadvantage: A long data cable is prone to interference, which may lead to disconnection.
