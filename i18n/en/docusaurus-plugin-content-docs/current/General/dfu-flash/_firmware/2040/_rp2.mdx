* Please note that the current toolboard is in firmware burning mode and can only burn firmware with a .uf2 suffix.
* Use the following command to burn the firmware to the toolboard.

```bash
cd && cd ~/klipper/
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003
```
:::tip
If this is the first burn after writing the system with the host machine, you may see a prompt similar to the one circled in red below â€” partial red prompts are normal and not an error.
