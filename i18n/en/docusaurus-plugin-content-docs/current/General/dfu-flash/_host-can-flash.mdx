:::tip

* It is recommended not to perform ID finding and firmware flashing during the printing process.
* The CAN firmware IDs of the same motherboard or tool board Katapult are completely consistent with the Klipper CAN firmware IDs.

:::

:::warning

* Ensure that the CAN network of the host computer has been configured.
* You can use the following command to search for the CAN ID only when `1d50:606f` appears after running `lsusb`.
* The CAN rate of the tool board must be consistent with the host computer; otherwise, the ID cannot be found and burned.

:::

* Execute the following command to query the CANBus UUID:

    ```bash
    ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```

    * After entering, you will encounter one of the following situations based on your machine. Below are references:
        * First case: A motherboard with bridge firmware installed displays an ID and prompts `Application: Klipper`.

        * Second case: A motherboard with bridge firmware installed, along with a tool board that requires firmware burning, displays two IDs.
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid1.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
        * Third case: Using UTOC with a tool board that requires firmware burning.
        * Tip: UTOC does not display the ID.
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid2.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
        * Fourth case: No ID prompt, generally due to Klipper occupation, incorrect CAN0 rate of the host computer, or wiring abnormalities.

    * Normally, if the tool board that needs to be burned is in CANBOOT mode, it will prompt `Application: CanBoot`, and the corresponding firmware light will flash. At this point, you need to burn the Klipper firmware; otherwise, it cannot be connected!!!
    * Tip: If it is a Klipper firmware and the ID has been filled into the configuration, the ID will not be displayed and will be occupied by Klipper. You need to shield the corresponding ID and power off/restart the mainboard completely.

    :::warning

    * If no UUID is queried, please refer to the following document.

# Firmware Burning

    * Replace `241696050c56` in the following command with the UUID found during the query. Please note that there is a space after `-u`.
        ```bash
        python3 ~/klipper/lib/canboot/flash_can.py -u 241696050c56
        ```

    * As shown in the figure below, if `CAN Flash Success` appears, the burning is successful.

## If you need to update the firmware, just re-execute the burning instruction after compiling the firmware, but ensure that the ID can be found or Klipper is already connected.

        ```bash
        python3 ~/klipper/lib/canboot/flash_can.py -u  <MCU ID>
        ```
