:::tip

* It is recommended not to find the ID or flash the firmware during the printing process.
* The CAN firmware of the same motherboard or tool board Katapult and the CAN firmware of Klipper have completely consistent IDs.

:::

:::warning

* Please ensure that the CAN network of the host computer has been configured.
* You can use the following command to search for the CAN ID only when `1d50:606f` appears after running `lsusb`.
* The CAN rate of the tool board must be consistent with the host computer, otherwise the ID cannot be found and burned.

:::

* Execute the following command to query the CANBus UUID:

    ```bash
    ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```
    Use this command to burn the `fast` system, *replace `<your motherboard ID>` with the ID queried in the previous step.*
    
     ```bash
    python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
     ```

    * After inputting, one of the following situations will appear depending on your machine, the following are references:
        * First type: The motherboard with the bridge firmware installed will display an ID and prompt `Application: Klipper`
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />  
        * Second type: The motherboard with the bridge firmware installed and the tool board that needs to be burned with firmware will display two IDs
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid1.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />  
        * Third type: Using UTOC with the tool board that needs to be burned
        * Tip: UTOC does not display the ID
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid2.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />  
        * Fourth type: No ID prompt, usually because the klipper is occupied, the CAN0 rate of the host computer is incorrect, or there is a wiring anomaly
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid3.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />  

    * Normally, if the tool board that needs to be burned is in the CANBOOT state, it will prompt `Application: CanBoot` and the corresponding firmware light will flash. At this time, you need to burn the Klipper firmware, otherwise it cannot be connected!!!
    * Tip: If it is Klipper firmware and the ID has been entered into the configuration, the ID will not be displayed and will be occupied by Klipper. You need to disable the corresponding ID and restart the motherboard completely after cutting off the power.

    :::warning

    * If the UUID is not queried, please refer to the documentation below.

# Firmware Burning

    * Replace `241696050c56` in the following command with the UUID found in the UUID query, note that there is a space after `-u`
        ```bash
        python3 ~/klipper/lib/canboot/flash_can.py -u 241696050c56
        ```

    * As shown in the figure below, if `CAN Flash Success` appears, the burning is successful.

## Firmware Update
    * If you need to update the firmware, you only need to re-execute the burning instruction after compiling the firmware.
    * But please make sure that the corresponding ID can be found or Klipper is already connected.
        ```bash
        python3 ~/klipper/lib/canboot/flash_can.py -u  <MCU ID>
        ```
