:::tip

* It is recommended not to perform ID search and firmware flashing during the printing process.
* The CAN firmware IDs of the same motherboard or Katapult tool board are completely consistent with Klipper's CAN firmware IDs.

:::

:::warning

* Please ensure that the can network on the host machine has been configured.
* You can only use the following command to search for the CAN ID when `lsusb` shows `1d50:606f`.
* The CAN baud rate of the tool board must be consistent with the host machine, otherwise, you will not be able to find the ID and burn it.

:::

* Execute the following command to query the CANBus UUID:

    ```bash
    ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```

* After entering, you will encounter one of the following scenarios based on your machine. Below are references:
    * First scenario: If the mainboard has been flashed with bridge firmware, a single ID will appear along with the prompt `Application: Klipper`.

    * Second scenario: If the mainboard has been flashed with bridge firmware and is paired with a tool board that needs to be burned, two IDs will appear.

    * Third scenario: When using UTOC paired with a tool board that needs to be burned.
    * Note: UTOC does not display an ID.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/canid2.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
    * Fourth scenario: No ID prompt appears. Generally, this indicates that the klipper is occupied, the host machine's CAN0 baud rate is incorrect, or there is a wiring issue.

* Normally, if the tool board that needs to be burned is in CANBOOT mode, it will prompt `Application: CanBoot`, and the corresponding firmware light will flash. At this point, you need to burn the Klipper firmware; otherwise, you will not be able to connect!!!
* Note: If it is Klipper firmware and the ID has already been entered into the configuration, the ID will not be displayed and will be occupied by Klipper. You need to shield the corresponding ID and fully power off and restart the mainboard.

:::warning

* If the UUID is not queried, please refer to the documentation below.

* Firmware Flashing

* Replace `241696050c56` in the following command with the UUID found from querying the UUID. Please note that there should be a space after `-u`.
    ```bash
    python3 ~/klipper/lib/canboot/flash_can.py -u 241696050c56
    ```

* As shown in the image below, if `CAN Flash Success` appears, the burning was successful.

* If you need to update the firmware, simply re-execute the burning command after compiling the firmware. However, make sure you can find the ID or Klipper is already connected.

    ```bash
    python3 ~/klipper/lib/canboot/flash_can.py -u <MCU ID>
    ```
