    * Supports one-click copying of device ID, automatic identification of ID and adding corresponding configurations in front such as **serial:** , **canbus_uuid:** , **device:**
    * Supports CAN rate and CAN cache modification, making it convenient for players to customize CAN
    * Supports camera device inquiry, avoiding the trouble for players to search for cameras

    :::tip Tip

    * Please note that FLY-Tools will not automatically create CAN configuration and you need to create CAN configuration yourself before using CAN rate and CAN cache modification

    :::


    * Please provide SSH to use network connection to your user and then execute the following commands
    * Ubuntu does not support this feature temporarily

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 1000000
