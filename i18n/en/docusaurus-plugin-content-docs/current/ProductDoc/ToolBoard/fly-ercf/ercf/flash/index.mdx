    :::tip

    * ERCF comes pre-flashed with Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M
    * ERCF CAN-connected Katapult firmware rates are 500K and 1M, which can be burned if needed

# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * ERCF can be connected to the host computer via CAN connection
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the style of `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Notice
* Motherboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the motherboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need for the last burning of Katapult firmware, which is just to prevent the motherboard's Katapult firmware from not being burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the motherboard, if so, it means the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * ERCF can be connected to the host computer in the following ways
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, the firmware can be updated without touching the motherboard, and bus connection is supported
        * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
        * Tip: If CAN is needed, make sure the host computer supports CAN and needs to be used with UTOC or a motherboard burned with bridge firmware
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./usb">USB Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If Katapult firmware is burned, the firmware can be updated without touching the motherboard. If a memory card or DFU burning is used, it still needs to be updated in the original way. The communication is reliable and stable
        * Disadvantage: Multiple USB devices may affect data transmission
