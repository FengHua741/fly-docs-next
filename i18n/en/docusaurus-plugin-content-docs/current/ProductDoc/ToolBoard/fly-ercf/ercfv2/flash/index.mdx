:::tip
* ERCF V2 comes pre-flashed with Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M.
* ERCF V2 CAN-connected Katapult firmware rates are available in 500K and 1M; you can burn your own if needed.

# Firmware Burning Instructions

* ERCF V2 can connect to the host computer using RS232 or CAN.
* RS232 and CAN require the use of `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
* Below is the style of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable.

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning requires burning Klipper through Katapult.
* If you are sure that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the Katapult firmware at the end; that is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not burned successfully.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the mainboard starts flashing; if it does, it means the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

* ERCF V2 can connect to the host computer in the following ways.
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
    * Advantage: If you have burned the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the mainboard, and it supports bus connection.
    * Disadvantage: Using it together with `KlipperScreen` may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
    * Tip: If you need to use CAN, make sure the host computer supports CAN and it needs to be paired with UTOC or a mainboard burned with bridge firmware.
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware Burning</Button>
    * Advantage: No special software is required for use, communication is reliable and stable.
    * Disadvantage: Reburning the firmware requires entering manual DFU to update the firmware or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware.
    * Tip: Needs to be used in conjunction with G2T or UTOR.
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="./usb">USB Firmware Burning</Button>
    * Advantage: If you have burned the Katapult firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the mainboard. If using a memory card or DFU burning, you still need to update the firmware in the original way. Communication is reliable and stable.
    * Disadvantage: Multiple USB devices may affect data transmission.
