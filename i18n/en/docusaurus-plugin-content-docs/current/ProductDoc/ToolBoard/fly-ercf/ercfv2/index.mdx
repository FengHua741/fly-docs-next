## Product Features

    * MCU: Raspberry Pi rp2040, Dual core ARM Cortex-M0+@133MHz
    * Supports CAN mode, RS232 mode
    * Two drive positions, supports UART and SPI drive
    * Compatible with the original ERCF EASY Board
    * Extremely compact size, using 4-layer board design
    * Replaced the 14PIN extension port with XHD2.54, making the wiring more secure to prevent disconnection
    * Supports 12-24V voltage
