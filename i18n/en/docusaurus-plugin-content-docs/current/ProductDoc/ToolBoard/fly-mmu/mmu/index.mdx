# Product Introduction

    Fly-MMU is a multifunctional tool board, a high-performance control board designed specifically for 3D printers and automated equipment. It integrates a powerful H723 microcontroller, supports up to four TMC stepper motor drivers, and supports high-voltage drive. It comes with 11 limit switch inputs and can extend 16 limits through FPC, as well as 4 servo control outputs. The tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware and provides CAN bus and RS232 connection options for flexible communication and control solutions.
