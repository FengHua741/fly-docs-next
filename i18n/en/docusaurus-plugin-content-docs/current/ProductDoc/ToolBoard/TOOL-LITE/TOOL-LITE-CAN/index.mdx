# Introduction

# 1. Product Overview

FLY TOOL-LITE-CAN is a tool board designed by Guangzhou Maglun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printers. This tool board provides an xt30/kf interface, which can replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head with four wires, optimizing the layout. TOOL-LITE-CAN is suitable for 36/42 stepper motors and integrates a CANBus transceiver, TypeC port, TMC2209 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other features. This tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware.
