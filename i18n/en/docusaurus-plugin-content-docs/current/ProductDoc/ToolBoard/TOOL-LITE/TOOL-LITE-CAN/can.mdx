# CAN Firmware Compilation

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Select **GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup**, input: **!gpio18**
    :::warning
        Please enter `!gpio18` in English input mode.
    :::
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/TOOL-LITE/TOOL-LITE-CAN/img/can.webp').default} size="95%" align="center" />
    * **Please check against the above image to ensure it matches the image, then proceed to the next step**
    * Press `Q` key, a **Save configuration** message will appear, press `Y` again at this time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and exited back to the command line interface
    * Enter the following command to start compiling, it may take some time
    ```bash
    make -j4
    ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output is as follows, compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating bin file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Host Computer Configuration
    :::warning
        If your host computer is a **FLY** host computer, skip the `Host Computer Configuration` step.
    :::

    :::warning
       If your host computer is a **non-FLY** host computer, please execute the following steps
    :::

    ### Check if the Host Computer Supports CAN

    * If it is a **FLY host computer**, no action is required for this step
    * If your system is `Ubuntu`, you need to configure `Ubuntu CAN0`, but this document has not been updated yet
    * Enter the following command to check if the system supports CAN
    ```bash
    sudo modprobe can && echo "Your kernel supports CAN" || echo "Your kernel does not support CAN"
    ```
    * After entering the above command, if your kernel supports CAN, it will return: `Your kernel supports CAN`; if it does not support, it will return: `Your kernel does not support CAN`.
    :::tip
        If the return is `Your kernel supports CAN`, you can proceed to the next step of configuring CAN0; if the return is `Your kernel does not support CAN`, please replace the host computer system or change the host computer!
    :::
   
   ### Configure CAN0

    * This command overrides the original system CAN0 configuration, and the system needs to be restarted after execution
    * Choose one according to the actual situation (Klipper default CAN speed is 1M, it is recommended to use 1M speed)

    :::warning
        For 1M speed, enter the following command
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
        allow-hotplug can0
        iface can0 can static
            bitrate 1000000
            up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
            pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
            pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    :::warning
        For 500K speed, enter the following command
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 500000
        up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
        pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
        pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    * Restart the device

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## Confirm Whether Entering Burning Mode
    * Ensure that the host computer can connect to the network normally and that the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host computer has data transmission function.
    * After SSH connecting to the host computer, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback, this indicates an issue with the host computer system, and we are unable to help. You need to replace with a confirmed normal system or change the host computer.
        * If the prompt says there is no `lsusb` command, you can run the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```

    * The suffix of `OpenMoko, Inc. Geschwister Schneider CAN adapter` serves as a basis for judgment.
        * Some host computers may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.


## Burn Firmware
    * Before burning the firmware, use an XT30 data cable to connect the tool board to UTOC or the main board flashed with bridge firmware. Below is the reference wiring diagram
    * Pay attention to whether the DIP switch is set to the corresponding position

    * Ensure that the resistance between CAN H and CAN L is measured with a multimeter in the range of `60立` when powered off. If it is `120立`, a `120立` jumper must be connected; if it is around `40立`, the jumper must be removed

## Confirm Whether the Firmware Has Started

    * If the firmware starts normally, the LED will light up
