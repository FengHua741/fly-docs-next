# 1. Product Overview

FLY SB2040 PRO V3 is a tool board launched by Guangzhou Meilun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburner print head. Using this tool board, the original complicated wiring between the mainboard and the print head can be replaced with four wires to optimize the layout. SB2040 is suitable for stealthburner and afterburner, integrating functions such as CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, USB port, TMC2240 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, and three controllable fans. This tool board is compatible with Klipper and RRF firmware.
