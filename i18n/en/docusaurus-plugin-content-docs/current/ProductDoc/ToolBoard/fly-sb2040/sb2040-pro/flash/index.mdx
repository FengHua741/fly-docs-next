# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the last Katapult firmware, which is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the mainboard, if so, it means the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware
:::

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

* SB2040 PRO can be connected to the host computer in the following ways
* [CAN Firmware](./can.mdx "Click to jump")
    * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is flashed, the firmware can be updated without touching the mainboard, and bus connection is supported
    * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
    * Tip: If CAN is needed, please make sure the host computer supports CAN, and it needs to be paired with UTOC or a mainboard with bridging firmware flashed

## Katapult Firmware Description

* SB2040 PRO comes with Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M by default
