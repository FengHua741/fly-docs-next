# 1. Product Introduction

    FLY SB2040 V3 is a tool board launched by Guangzhou Maglun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburber print head. With this tool board, four wires can be used to replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. SB2040 is suitable for stealthburner and afterburner. It integrates CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, three controllable fans, and other functions of the tool board. This tool board is suitable for Klipper and RRF firmware.
