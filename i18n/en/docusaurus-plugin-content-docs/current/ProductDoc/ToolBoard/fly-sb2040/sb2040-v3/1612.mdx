# Eddy Usage

    :::info

    * Please note that it is recommended to use a separate Z limit for bed sweeping, and it is not recommended to use the bed sweeping as the Z limit.
    * When installing Eddy, the position of the bottom relative to the nozzle should be at least 1 - 2 mm above the nozzle.
    * When calibrating the Eddy frequency, the coil PCB should be at least 5 mm away from the heated bed.
    * Please do not test the entire heated bed at room temperature, and do not turn on the heated bed during the test.

## Reference Configuration and Usage Instructions

##### Add the following configuration to the `printer.cfg` configuration file to debug Eddy.

    ### Bed Sweeping Configuration

        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 2.0
        i2c_address: 43
        i2c_mcu: SB2040
        i2c_bus: i2c1b
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

    ### Temperature Compensation Configuration

        ```cfg
        [temperature_probe fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type:Generic 3950
        sensor_pin:SB2040:gpio28
        ```

    ## Mesh Bed Commands

        * Add the following macro to the `printer.cfg` configuration.
            ```bash
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
             rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
             gcode: 
                   _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan {rawparams}
            ```
        * For the local area network bed command, it is necessary to ensure that Klipper can use the object exclusion function. It is recommended to add it to the start macro.
            ```bash
            BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan adaptive=1 
            ```

### bed_mesh Configuration

    * For the `horizontal_move_z` parameter in [bed_mesh], it is recommended to set it to 2 to make Eddy as close to the platform as possible when scanning the platform.

    ```cfg
    [bed_mesh]
    horizontal_move_z: 2
    ```
## Anti-collision Macro

    ### `[quad_gantry_level]` Bed Sweeping Optimization
        * If `[quad_gantry_level]` is configured, the following macro can be added to the configuration. If not, there is no need to add it.
        * This macro will reduce the detection height as the height difference of the gantry decreases.
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL]
            rename_existing: _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.quad_gantry_level.applied %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_QGL
            ```

    ### `[z_tilt]` Bed Sweeping Optimization

        * If `[z_tilt]` is configured, the following macro can be added to the configuration. If not, there is no need to add it.
        * This macro will reduce the detection height as the height difference of the gantry decreases.
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro Z_TILT_ADJUST]
            rename_existing: _Z_TILT_ADJUST
            gcode:
                SAVE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
                BED_MESH_CLEAR
                {% if not printer.z_tilt.applied %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=10 retry_tolerance=1
                {% endif %}
                _Z_TILT_ADJUST horizontal_move_z=2 METHOD=rapid_scan ADAPTIVE=1
                # G28 Z
                RESTORE_GCODE_STATE NAME=STATE_Z_TILT
            ```

    ### Eddy is likely to be interfered by the heated bed during bed sweeping optimization macro

        * If a high-power AC heated bed (above 500W) is used.
        * The following macro is to turn off the heated bed during bed sweeping and reheat it after the bed sweeping is completed.
            ```cfg
            [gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
            rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
            gcode:
                {% set TARGET_TEMP = printer.heater_bed.target %}
                M140 S0
                _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE {rawparams}
                M140 S{TARGET_TEMP}
            ```

   # Debugging Steps: 
   ## The First Step: Modify the Frequency

    ### Default Frequency Modification of ldc16121612
    This method is only for sht36-v3/SB2040-v3 or SB2040-Pro-v3.
    The Mobaxterm tool can be used to execute the commands.

    Download the required <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ResDownload/auxiliary_software/">Mobaxterm tool</Button>.

    [For detailed usage, please refer to](/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/ssh).


    Execute the first command and press Enter.

    ```cfg
sed -i 's/LDC1612_FREQ = 12000000/LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000/g' ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
    ```

    Execute the second command and press Enter.
  ```cfg
grep "LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000" ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
  ```
    If the replacement is successful, a line with `LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000` will be returned, indicating that the replacement is successful. If there is no return, it means the replacement is not successful.
    Or use this command to check if it is successful.
