# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * SB2040 V3 can be connected to the host computer using RS232 and CAN two connection methods
    * RS232 and CAN need to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style

:::danger Notice
* Motherboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the motherboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the Katapult firmware at the end, which is just to prevent the motherboard's Katapult firmware from not being burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the motherboard, if so, it means that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SB2040 V3 can be connected to the host computer in the following ways
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, the firmware can be updated without touching the motherboard, and bus connection is supported
        * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, please make sure the host computer supports CAN, and it needs to be matched with UTOC or a motherboard burned with bridge firmware
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: No special software is required to use, communication is reliable and stable
        * Disadvantage: Re-flashing the firmware requires entering manual DFU to update the firmware or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware
        * Tip: It needs to be used together with G2T or UTOR
