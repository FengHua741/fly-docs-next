## Product Overview

    FLY SB2040 is a nozzle tool board launched by Guangzhou Meilun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for the VORON Stealthburber print head. Using this tool board, four wires can replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. SB2040 is suitable for 36-step stepper motors and integrates functions such as CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, etc. This tool board is suitable for Klipper firmware.

    * Supports CAN bus connection, more stable data transmission, lower latency, more stable connection
    * On-board TMC2209 driver, using UART mode, can be used for extruders
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports BLTOUCH, PL08N and other leveling sensors, integrates XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input 
    * MCU: Raspberry Pi rp2040, Dual core ARM Cortex-M0+@133MHz
    * Added support for 4.7K resistor (for ntc thermistor) or 1K resistor (for PT1000) switching
    * CAN interface uses XT30 (2+2), supports 15A current, peak 30A
    * Added on-board NTC100k resistor for measuring chamber temperature
    * Added INT1 and INT2 of ADXL345 to MCU, for individual users for leveling.
    * Supports high voltage input limit
    * Comes with 3 meters of CAN connecting cable to avoid signal loss due to incorrect terminal pressing by users
    * Supports 2/3/4-wire fans
    * Detachable design, Stealthburner is easy to disassemble
    * Compatible with hartk's Stealthburner Toolhead Board (fan小板可以不用更换)
    * Interface:可控风扇\*3，RGB\*1，限位\*3，加热管\*1，热敏\*1
