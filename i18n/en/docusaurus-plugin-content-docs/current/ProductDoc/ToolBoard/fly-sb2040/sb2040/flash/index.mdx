    :::tip

    * SB2040 comes pre-flashed with Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M
    * SB2040 CAN-connected Katapult firmware is available in 500K and 1M rates, which can be burned if needed

# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * SB2040 can be connected to the host computer via CAN connection
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the style of `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the Katapult firmware at the end, which is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the mainboard, if so, it means the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SB2040 can only use CAN to connect to the host computer
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, it can update the firmware without touching the mainboard and supports bus connection
        * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, please make sure the host computer supports CAN and needs to be used together with UTOC or a mainboard burned with bridge firmware
