# Product Introduction

FLY-SHT36-PRO is a nozzle tool board designed by Guangzhou Melen Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extrusion heads. Using this tool board, four wires can replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. FLY-SHT36-PRO is suitable for 36-step motors and integrates a CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC5160 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other functions.

    * Extremely compact size with 6-layer board design
    * Supports CAN bus connection for more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connection
    * On-board TMC5160 can be used for the extruder
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Replaceable fan MOS design
    * Compatible with BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated with XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input 
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CANBUS, USB
