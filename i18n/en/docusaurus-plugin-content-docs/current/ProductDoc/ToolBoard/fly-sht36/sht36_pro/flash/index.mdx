# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * SHT36 PRO can be connected to the host computer via CAN connection
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the style of `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the Katapult firmware at the end, which is just to prevent the mainboard's Katapult firmware from not being burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the mainboard, if so, it means the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware
:::

## CAN Firmware Compilation

    * SHT36 PRO can only be connected to the host computer via CAN
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, the firmware can be updated without touching the mainboard, and bus connection is supported
        * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
        * Hint: If CAN is needed, please make sure the host computer supports CAN, and it needs to be used together with UTOC or a mainboard burned with bridge firmware
