# Firmware Burning Instructions

* SHT36 LIS3DH can only be connected to the host computer via CAN connection
* CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
* Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the last Katapult firmware, which is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the mainboard, if so, it means the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware
:::

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

* SHT36 LIS3DH can be connected to the host computer in the following ways
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
    * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, the firmware can be updated without touching the mainboard, and bus connection is supported
    * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause positioning timeout and other errors.
    * Tip: If CAN is needed, please make sure the host computer supports CAN, and it needs to be used with UTOC or a mainboard burned with bridge firmware
