# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * Firmware compilation and firmware burning both require the use of a host computer
    * SHT36 V2 can be connected to the host computer using CAN connection
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/xt30.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />

:::danger Notice
* Motherboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the motherboard has been burned with Katapult, then there is no need for the last burning of Katapult firmware, that is just to prevent the motherboard's Katapult firmware from not being burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the motherboard, if so, it means the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## CAN Firmware Compilation

    * SHT36 V2 can only be connected to the host computer using CAN method
    * STM 103 please see <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can103">103CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
    * APM 072 and STM 072 please see <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can072">072CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
