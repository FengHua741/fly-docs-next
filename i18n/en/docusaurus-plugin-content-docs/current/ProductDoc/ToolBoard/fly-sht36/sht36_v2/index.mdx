# Introduction

## Product Overview

    FLY SHT36 V2 is a nozzle tool board designed by Guangzhou Maglun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extrusion heads. Using this tool board, four wires can be used to replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. SHT36 V2 is suitable for 36-step stepper motors and integrates a CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other features. This tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware.

    * Extremely compact size, using 6-layer board design
    * Supports CAN bus connection, more stable data transmission, lower latency, more stable connection
    * On-board TMC2209 driver, using UART mode, suitable for extruders
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Replaceable fan MOS design
    * Compatible with BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input 
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CAN
    * Compatible with BLTOUCH, PL08N, and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches

## New Features

    * Added support for 4.7K resistor (for NTC thermistor) or 1.1K resistor (for PT1000) switching
    * CAN interface no longer uses MX3.0 terminals, new connector supports 15A current, peak 30A
    * Added optional fan voltages of 5/12/24V.
    * Added on-board NTC100k resistor for measuring chamber temperature
    * Added power reverse protection
    * Added ADXL345 INT1 connected to MCU, for leveling by individual users.
    * Enlarged heater port, rated current 10A
    * Added high-voltage input limit
    * Changed main control to domestic MCU
    * Supports magnetic encoder (AS5047D), Klipper used for motion analysis (currently Klipper does not support)
    * Added 1-meter CAN connecting cable to avoid signal loss due to incorrect terminal pressing by users
    * Installation size: hole spacing 43.84mm, M3 mounting hole diameter
    * Processor: GD32F103 (purchased before October 28, 2022), APM32F072 (purchased after October 28, 2022)
