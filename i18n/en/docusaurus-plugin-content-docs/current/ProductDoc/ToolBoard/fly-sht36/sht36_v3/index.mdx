# 1. Product Introduction

FLY SHT36 V3 is a nozzle tool board designed by Guangzhou Meilun Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extrusion heads. Using this tool board, four wires can replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. SHT36 V3 is suitable for 36-step stepper motors and integrates a CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, Type-C port, TMC2209 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other features. This tool board is compatible with Klipper and RRF firmware.
