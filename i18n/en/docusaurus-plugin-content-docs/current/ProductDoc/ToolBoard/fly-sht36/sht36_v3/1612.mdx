# Eddy Usage

    :::info

    * Please note that it is recommended to use a separate Z limit switch for bed leveling, and do not use the bed leveling as the Z limit switch.
    * When installing Eddy, ensure that the bottom is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.
    * When calibrating the Eddy frequency, keep the coil PCB at least 5 mm away from the heatbed.
    * Please ensure the entire heatbed is at room temperature for testing, and do not turn on the heatbed during testing.

## Reference Configuration and Usage Instructions

    ### Modifying the default frequency of ldc1612
    This method is only for sht36-v3/SB2040-v3 or SB2040-Pro-v3
    You can use the Mobaxterm tool to execute commands

    Download the required <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ResDownload/auxiliary_software/">Mobaxterm tool</Button>

    [For detailed usage, please refer to](/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/ssh)


    Execute the first command and press Enter:

    ```cfg
sed -i 's/LDC1612_FREQ = 12000000/LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000/g' ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
    ```

    Execute the second command and press Enter:
  ```cfg
grep "LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000" ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
  ```
    If successful, it will return a line containing `LDC1612_FREQ = 40000000`. If there's no return, the replacement was not successful.
    Alternatively, use this command to check if the replacement was successful:
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/img/1612.webp').default} size="110%" align="left" />
```cfg
sed -n '10,15p' ~/klipper/klippy/extras/ldc1612.py
```
   <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/img/ldc161240mhz.webp').default} size="30%" align="left" />

   Friendly Reminder: After modification, use this command to restart the Klipper service and recalibrate the Eddy frequency:
   ```cfg
   systemctl restart klipper
   ```
   Eddy frequency calibration command:
   ```cfg
   PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=fly_eddy_probe
   ```


    ### Bed Leveling Configuration

        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 1.0
        i2c_address: 43
        i2c_mcu: SHT36
        i2c_bus: i2c1e
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

        * Please note that currently there is no external 1612 module available, so this configuration is temporarily unusable:
        ```cfg
        [probe_eddy_current fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type: ldc1612
        z_offset: 1.0
        i2c_address: 42
        i2c_mcu: SHT36
        i2c_bus: i2c1e
        x_offset: 0
        y_offset: 0
        speed:40
        lift_speed: 5
        ```

    ### Temperature Compensation Configuration

        ```cfg
        [temperature_probe fly_eddy_probe]
        sensor_type:Generic 3950
        sensor_pin:SHT36:gpio28
        ```

### bed_mesh Configuration

    * In [bed_mesh], set the `horizontal_move_z` parameter to 2, allowing Eddy to get as close as possible to the platform during scanning.

    ```cfg
    [bed_mesh]
    horizontal_move_z: 2
    ```
