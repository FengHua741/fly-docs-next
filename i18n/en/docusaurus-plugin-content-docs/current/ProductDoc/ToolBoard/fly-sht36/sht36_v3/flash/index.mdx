    :::tip

    * The SHT36 V3 is shipped with the Katapult firmware connected via CAN at a rate of 1M.
    * The Katapult firmware connected via CAN on the SHT36 V3 has rates of 500K and 1M; it can be burned independently if needed.

# Firmware Burning Instructions
    
    * Both firmware compilation and burning require an upper computer.
    * The SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper computer via RS232 or CAN.
    * RS232 and CAN need to use `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable:

:::danger Notice
* The mainboard firmware burning needs to burn Klipper through Katapult.
* If you are sure that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to perform the last Katapult firmware burning, as that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware burning on the mainboard was unsuccessful.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if a LED on the mainboard flashes; if so, it indicates that the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper computer using the following methods:
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="./can">CAN Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: After burning the `Katapult` firmware, the firmware can be updated without touching the mainboard, and it supports bus connections.
        * Disadvantage: There may be errors such as homing timeouts when using `KlipperScreen` together.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure that the upper computer supports CAN and pair it with UTOC or a mainboard flashed with bridge firmware.
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: No special software is required; communication is reliable and stable.
        * Disadvantage: Re-flashing the firmware requires entering manual DFU mode or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware.
        * Tip: It needs to be paired with G2T or UTOR to function.
