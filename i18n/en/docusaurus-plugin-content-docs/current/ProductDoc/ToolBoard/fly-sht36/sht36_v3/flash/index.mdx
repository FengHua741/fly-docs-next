:::tip

* SHT36 V3 comes pre-flashed with Katapult firmware for CAN connection at a rate of 1M
* SHT36 V3 CAN-connected Katapult firmware is available in 500K and 1M rates, which can be burned if needed
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./bl">Katapult Firmware Burning</Button>

# Firmware Burning Instructions

* Both firmware compilation and firmware burning require the use of a host computer
* SHT36 V3 can be connected to the host computer using RS232 or CAN
* RS232 and CAN need to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
* Below is the style of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has been burned with Katapult, there is no need for the last burning of Katapult firmware, which is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED flashing on the mainboard, which indicates that the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

* SHT36 V3 can be connected to the host computer in the following ways
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware</Button>
    * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, it can update the firmware without touching the mainboard and supports bus connection
    * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause homing timeout and other errors.
    * Tip: If CAN is needed, make sure the host computer supports CAN and needs to be used with UTOC or a mainboard burned with bridge firmware
* <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware</Button>
    * Advantage: No special software is required for use, communication is reliable and stable
    * Disadvantage: Re-flashing the firmware requires entering manual DFU to update the firmware or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware
    * Tip: Needs to be used with G2T or UTOR
