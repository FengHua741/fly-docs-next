# CAN Firmware Compilation

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Select **GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup**, input: **!gpio5**
    :::warning
        Please enter `!gpio5` in English input mode.
    :::
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/flash/img/can.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
    * **Please check against the above picture to ensure it is consistent with the picture, then proceed to the next step**
    * Press `Q`, a **Save configuration** message will appear, press `Y` again at this time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface
    * Enter the following command to start compiling, it takes some time
    ```bash
    make -j4
    ```
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output below appears, compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating bin file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Host Machine Configuration
    :::warning
        If your host machine is a **FLY** host machine, skip the `Host Machine Configuration` step.
    :::

    :::warning
       If your host machine is a **non-FLY** host machine, please execute the following steps.
    :::

    ### Check if the Host Machine Supports CAN

    * If it is a **FLY host machine**, this operation is not required.
    * If your system is `Ubuntu`, you need to configure `Ubuntu CAN0`, this document has not been updated yet.
    * Enter the following command to check if the system supports CAN
    ```bash
    sudo modprobe can && echo "Your kernel supports CAN" || echo "Your kernel does not support CAN"
    ```
    * After entering the above command, if your kernel supports CAN, it will return: `Your kernel supports CAN`; if not supported, it will return: `Your kernel does not support CAN`.
    :::tip
        If it returns `Your kernel supports CAN`, you can proceed to the next step to configure CAN0. If it returns `Your kernel does not support CAN`, please replace your host machine system or replace the host machine!
    :::
   
   ### Configure CAN0

    * This command overwrites the original CAN0 configuration of the system, and the system needs to be restarted after execution.
    * Please choose one according to the actual situation (**Klipper default CAN rate is 1M, it is recommended to use 1M rate**)

    :::warning
        For 1M rate, enter the following command
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
        allow-hotplug can0
        iface can0 can static
            bitrate 1000000
            up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
            pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
            pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    :::warning
        For 500K rate, enter the following command
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 500000
        up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
        pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
        pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    * Restart the device

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

    <LS />


## Burn Firmware

    * Before burning the firmware, connect the tool board to UTOC or the main board flashed with bridge firmware using an XT30 data cable, and refer to the wiring diagram below
    * Please pay attention to whether the DIP switch is set to the corresponding position

    * Please ensure that the resistance value between CAN H and CAN L is around `60立` when powered off; if it is `120立`, you need to connect a `120立` jumper wire; if it is around `40立`, you need to remove the jumper wire

    <CANFLASH />

## Confirm Firmware Startup

    * If the firmware starts up normally, the LED will light up
