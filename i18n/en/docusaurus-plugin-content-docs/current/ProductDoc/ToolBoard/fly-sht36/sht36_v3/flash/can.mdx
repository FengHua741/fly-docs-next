# CAN Firmware Compilation

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Select **GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup**, enter: **!gpio5**
    :::warning
        Please enter `!gpio5` in English input mode
    :::
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ToolBoard/fly-sht36/sht36_v3/flash/img/can.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
    * **Please check against the above image to ensure consistency before proceeding to the next step**
    * Press `Q` key, and when **Save configuration** appears, press `Y` key
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compilation, it takes some time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the following content is output, the compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Host Computer Configuration
    :::warning
        If your host computer is a **FLY** host, you do not need to perform the `Host Computer Configuration` step
    :::

    :::warning
       If your host computer is a **non-FLY** host, please follow the steps below
    :::

    ### Check if the Host Computer Supports CAN

    * If it is a **FLY host computer**, this operation is not needed
    * If your system is `Ubuntu`, you need `Ubuntu Configuration CAN0`, this document has not been updated
    * Enter the following command to check if the system supports CAN
    ```bash
    sudo modprobe can && echo "Your kernel supports CAN" || echo "Your kernel does not support CAN"
    ```
    * After entering the above command, if your kernel supports CAN, it will return: `Your kernel supports CAN`; if not, it will return: `Your kernel does not support CAN`.
    :::tip
        If it returns `Your kernel supports CAN`, you can proceed to the next step of configuring CAN0, if it returns `Your kernel does not support CAN`, then please change the host computer system or change the host computer!
    :::
   
   ### Configure CAN0

    * This command overrides the original system CAN0 configuration, and the system needs to be restarted after execution
    * Please choose one according to your actual situation (**Klipper default CAN rate is 1M, it is recommended to use 1M rate**)

    :::warning
        For 1M rate, enter the following command
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
        allow-hotplug can0
        iface can0 can static
            bitrate 1000000
            up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
            pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
            pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    :::warning
        For 500K rate, enter the following command
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 500000
        up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
        pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
        pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
    EOF
    ```

    * Restart the device

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## Burn Firmware         
         
    * Before burning the firmware, use an XT30 data cable to connect the tool board to the UTOC or the motherboard that has been flashed with the bridge firmware, the following is a reference wiring diagram
    * Please ensure that the dip switch is set to the correct position

    * Please ensure that the CAN H and CAN L have a resistance of about `60立` when measured with a multimeter under power-off conditions, if it is `120立`, you need to connect a `120立` jumper, if it is about `40立`, you need to remove the jumper

## Confirm if the Firmware has Started

    * If the firmware starts normally, the LED will light up
