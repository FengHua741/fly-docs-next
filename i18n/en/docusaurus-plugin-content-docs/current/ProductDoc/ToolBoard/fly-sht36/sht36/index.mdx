# Product Introduction

FLY SHT36/42 is a nozzle tool board designed by Guangzhou Mellen Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extrusion heads. Using this tool board, four wires can replace the complicated wiring between the original motherboard and the print head, optimizing the layout. SHT36 is suitable for 36-step motors, and SHT42 is suitable for 42-step motors. It integrates a CAN transceiver, USB port, TMC2209 driver, ADXL345 accelerometer, two controllable fans, and other features. This tool board is compatible with Klipper firmware.

    * Extremely compact size, using 6-layer board design
    * Supports CAN bus connection, more stable data transmission, lower latency, more stable connection
    * On-board TMC2209 driver, using UART mode, can be used for extruders
    * On-board ADXL345 accelerometer
    * Supports PT100 (MAX31865)
    * Replaceable fan MOS design
    * Compatible with BLTOUCH, PL08N and other leveling sensors, integrated XY limit switches
    * Supports 12-24V voltage input 
    * MCU: STM32F072
    * Communication: CANBUS, USB
    * Interfaces: Controllable fan*2, RGB*1, limit*3, Probe*1, Servo*1, heating rod*1, thermistor*1, PT100*1
