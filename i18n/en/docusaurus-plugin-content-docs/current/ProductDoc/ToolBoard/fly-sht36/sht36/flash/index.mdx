## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SHT36/42 can be connected to the host computer in CAM mode
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If `Katapult` firmware is burned, the firmware can be updated without touching the motherboard, and bus connection is supported
        * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause homing timeout and other errors.
        * Tip: If CAN is needed, please make sure the host computer supports CAN, and it needs to be used with UTOC or a motherboard with bridging firmware burned
