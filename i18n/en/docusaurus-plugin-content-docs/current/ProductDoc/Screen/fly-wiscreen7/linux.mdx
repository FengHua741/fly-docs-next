# Ethernet Cable Usage Tutorial


    :::tip

    The screen firmware needs to be manually updated

    :::

## Screen Firmware Download

    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/wiscreen/wiscreen7/Cable/update.img">Click to download the screen firmware</Button>

    * A memory card with a capacity of no more than 32GB is required, and the transfer speed of the TF card must be class10 or above. It is recommended to use a TF card from brands like SanDisk.

## System Packages Suitable for FLY Host Computers

:::tip
Suitable for C8 PI_V2 PI GEMINI series
:::

    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/IMG/Beta/FLY_OS%E7%BD%91%E7%BA%BF%E5%B1%8F%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F.img.xz">Download the system package</Button>


## Install Services

:::tip
Other host computers need to install services by themselves
:::

:::warning Note
The installation process requires an internet connection
:::
    ```bash
    sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
    ```
## Configure Network

:::tip
* This tutorial will occupy the host computer's Ethernet port, and only the connection to the screen can be used.
* If not needed, just completely delete the modified and added configurations below.
:::
    Modify `/etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0`

    ```bash
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.251.100
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 192.168.251.255
    network 192.168.251.0
    gateway 192.168.251.1
    ```

    Modify `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server`

    ```bash
    # Defaults for isc-dhcp-server (sourced by /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server)

    # Path to dhcpd's config file (default: /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf).
    #DHCPDv4_CONF=/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
    #DHCPDv6_CONF=/etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf

    # Path to dhcpd's PID file (default: /var/run/dhcpd.pid).
    #DHCPDv4_PID=/var/run/dhcpd.pid
    #DHCPDv6_PID=/var/run/dhcpd6.pid

    # Additional options to start dhcpd with.
    #       Don't use options -cf or -pf here; use DHCPD_CONF/ DHCPD_PID instead
    #OPTIONS=""

    # On what interfaces should the DHCP server (dhcpd) serve DHCP requests?
    #       Separate multiple interfaces with spaces, e.g. "eth0 eth1".
    INTERFACESv4="eth0"
    #INTERFACESv4="eth0"
    INTERFACESv6=""
    #INTERFACES="eth0"

    INTERFACES="eth0"
    ```

    Modify `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`, add the following content at the end

    ```bash
    # ddns-update-style none;
    subnet 192.168.251.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.251.100 192.168.251.200;
        option routers 192.168.251.1;
        option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4; # Google Public DNS as an example
        default-lease-time 600; # Default lease time in seconds
        max-lease-time 7200;    # Maximum lease time in seconds
    }
    ```

    Restart the system first, then execute the following restart service

    Or restart the network service

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```

    This operation will disconnect and reconnect the internet

    Restart the service

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
    ```

    The local IP address should be `192.168.251.100`

## Improve WIFI Priority

:::tip
* This command is to improve network priority. If it is not added, it will not be able to connect to the internet and download things properly!!!
:::
    * Please add the following instructions in `/etc/rc.local` on the host computer

    ```bash
    sudo ip route del default && sudo ip route add default via $(ip route show dev wlan0 | grep 'default via' | awk 'NR==1 {print $3}') dev wlan0
    ```
