# Introduction

* The device features a unique FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) port design, allowing direct connection to the Fly design motherboard without the need for HDMI and USB cables. This simplified FPC connection reduces cable clutter and ensures a clean, efficient interface. Despite this advanced connectivity method, the device also retains a standard HDMI port for users who prefer traditional connection options.
In addition to flexible connectivity, the device includes smart function keys for easy adjustment of brightness, screen rotation, and rebooting. High-quality imported foam adhesive ensures strong screen adhesion and excellent durability. Dual-side low-impedance heat dissipation technology enhances touch sensitivity, providing a smoother user experience. Yellow light technology offers precise color reproduction with a standard brightness of 500, preventing overexposure. The screen is protected by high-strength tempered glass, ensuring robust protection against damage.
The device is fully compatible with host systems like Raspberry Pi, and features a hidden HDMI port design with cables neatly concealed at the back of the device for a clean, professional look. Its high-performance circuit design guarantees seamless operation, making it an ideal choice for stable and reliable 3D printers.
