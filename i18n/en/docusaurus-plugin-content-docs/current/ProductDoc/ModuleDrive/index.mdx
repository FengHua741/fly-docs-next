## Drive Installation

    * Please note that EN needs to be aligned with the upper left corner for installation
    * The EN pins of the FLY motherboard drive port are all in the upper left

## Drive Configuration

    * The configuration method for TP drives and ordinary drives is the same
    * FLY-2240 drive supports UART connection, but requires manual modification of resistors
    * Pay attention to the drive sampling resistor; incorrect configuration may cause damage to motors and drives
