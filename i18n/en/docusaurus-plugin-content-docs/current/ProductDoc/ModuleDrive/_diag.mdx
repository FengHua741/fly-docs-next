:::tip Infinite Position Usage Tips

* Infinite position usage requires occupying a limit port; normally, the first drive position uses IO1, the second drive position uses IO2, and so on.
* When using infinite positions, please ensure not to connect anything to the corresponding limit port.
* For some FLY mainboards that are directly connected to the drive port, please check if DIAG is directly connected to the corresponding pin.
