## TMC-5160

    * Input voltage: 12V-48V
    * Maximum current: 4.4A
    * Suitable for: Marlin/Klipper/RRF firmware
    * Drive mode support: TMC: SPI
    * Stepper/direction interface with microstepping interpolation microPlyer
    * Highest resolution of 256 microsteps
    * Supports stealthChop2 silent operation and smooth motion
    * Supports resonance suppression for mid-frequency resonance
    * Supports spreadCycle high-dynamic motor control chopper
    * Supports dcStep load-related speed control
    * Supports stallGuard2 high-precision sensorless motor load detection
    * Supports coolStep current control, up to 75% energy savings

## TP5160 Reference Configuration

    :::danger

    * The drive sampling resistor is `sense_resistor: 0.075` please do not set incorrectly
    * spi_bus and spi_software can only choose one

### SPI Mode Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [tmc5160 stepper_x]
    cs_pin:
    spi_bus:
    # spi_software_mosi_pin:
    # spi_software_miso_pin:
    # spi_software_sclk_pin: 
    run_current: 1.0                    # Motor running current value
    interpolate: False                  # Whether to enable 256 microstep interpolation (True to enable, False to disable)
    sense_resistor: 0.075
    stealthchop_threshold: 0
    driver_DISS2G: 1
    driver_DISS2VS: 1
    ```

## Infinite Position Usage Instructions

    <DIAG />

    :::tip Infinite Position Usage Tips
    
    * To use TP5160 infinite position, the motherboard's DIAG jumper must be connected
    * The original `endstop_pin:` needs to be shielded or deleted, and add `endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop`
    * After configuring `diag1_pin:`, the limit status is not triggered
    * Configuring `driver_SGT: :` requires testing an appropriate value by yourself

    :::

    * Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [stepper_x]
    # endstop_pin:PF3
    endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop
    homing_retract_dist: 0        # Retraction without changing to 0 may cause homing failure

    [tmc5160 stepper_x]
    diag1_pin: ^!
    driver_SGT: 1

    # Please ensure the limit status is not triggered after configuration
    # This pin usually uses "^" prefix to enable internal pull-up
    # Sensitivity is related to belt tightness and needs to be adjusted by yourself
    # (Ensure that driver_SGTHRS is also set to an appropriate sensitivity)
