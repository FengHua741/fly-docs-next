    * Maximum Current: 3.0A
    * Suitable for: Marlin/Klipper/RRF firmware
    * Drive Mode Support: TMC: SPI
    * Step/Direction interface with microPlyer support
    * Maximum resolution: 256 microsteps
    * Supports stealthChop2 silent operation and smooth motion
    * Supports resonance suppression at medium frequencies
    * Supports spreadCycle high dynamic motor control chopper
    * Supports dcStep load-related speed control
    * Supports stallGuard2 high precision sensorless motor load detection
    * Supports coolStep current control, up to 75% energy saving



## TP2240 Reference Configuration

    :::danger

    * The driver sampling resistor is `rref: 12300`, please do not set it incorrectly
    * Only one of spi_bus and spi_software can be selected
    
    :::

### SPI Mode Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [tmc2240 stepper_x]
    cs_pin: 
    spi_bus: 
    # spi_software_mosi_pin:
    # spi_software_miso_pin:
    # spi_software_sclk_pin: 
    run_current: 0.65                   # Motor running current value
    interpolate: False                  # Whether to enable 256 microstep interpolation (not recommended to enable)
    rref: 12300
    stealthchop_threshold: 0           # Silence threshold (if silence is not needed, change the value to 0)
    ```

## Infinite Endstop Usage Instructions

    <DIAG />

    :::tip Infinite Endstop Usage Tips
    
    * To use the infinite endstop of TP2240, the motherboard's DIAG jumper must be connected
    * The original `endstop_pin:` needs to be disabled or deleted, and add `endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop`
    * After configuring `diag1_pin:`, the limit status should be untriggered
    * For `driver_SGT:`, a suitable value needs to be tested manually

    :::

    * Reference configuration

    ```cfg
    [stepper_x]
    # endstop_pin:PF3
    endstop_pin: tmc2240_stepper_x:virtual_endstop
    homing_retract_dist: 0        # Retract distance cannot be changed to 0, otherwise homing may fail

    [tmc2240 stepper_x]
    diag1_pin: ^!
    driver_SGT: 1

    #   After configuration, ensure that the limit status is untriggered
    #   This pin usually uses "^" prefix to enable internal pull-up
    #   Sensitivity is related to belt tension and needs to be adjusted manually
    #  (Make sure to set driver_SGTHRS to a suitable sensitivity at the same time)

    ```
