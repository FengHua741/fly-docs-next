## Filament Runout Function Configuration

<div style={{
    border: '3px solid #d32f2f',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    background: '#fffbe6',
    padding: '20px',
    margin: '20px 0',
    textAlign: 'center',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: '1.4em',
    color: '#d32f2f',
    boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(211,47,47,0.08)'
}}>
⚠️ The filament diameter in the configuration file <strong>must be changed to 2.85mm</strong><br/>
and also <strong>changed to 2.85mm</strong> in the printer configuration profile of the slicer.
</div>

```cfg
[filament_switch_sensor mdm_switch_sensor]
switch_pin: ^PG12 # Replace with the pin being used, connected to the runout detection pin
pause_on_runout: True
# When set to "True", the printer will pause immediately after detecting exhaustion.
# Note that if pause_on_runout is False and no runout_gcode is defined,
# the runout detection will be disabled.
# Default is True.

runout_gcode:
    PAUSE
    M118 Filament Out
# insert_gcode:
event_delay: 1.0
# Minimum time delay (in seconds) between events.
# Events triggered within this timeframe will be ignored by default.
# Default is 3 seconds.

pause_delay: 0.5
# Delay time (in seconds) between the pause command and executing runout_gcode.
# If using OctoPrint, increasing this delay may improve the reliability of the pause.
# If OctoPrint exhibits strange pause behavior, consider increasing this delay.
# Default is 0.5 seconds.

```

## Filament Jam Function Configuration

```cfg
[filament_motion_sensor mdm_motion_sensor]
switch_pin: PD6       # Replace with the pin being used, connected to the jam detection pin
detection_length: 3.7 # Minimum distance for triggering a change in the state of the switch_pin
extruder: extruder
# The extruder associated with this sensor.
# This parameter must be provided.
    
# pause_on_runout:
runout_gcode:
    PAUSE
    M118 Jammed
# insert_gcode:
event_delay: 3.0
pause_delay: 1.0

```
