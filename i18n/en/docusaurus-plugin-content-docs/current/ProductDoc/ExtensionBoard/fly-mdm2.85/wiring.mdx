:::danger Notice
    - The input power only supports DC5V. When wiring, make sure to distinguish between positive and negative poles, and the wiring process must be carried out under power-off condition. Confirm that the wiring is correct before powering on; any losses caused by incorrect wiring will not be borne by our company.
