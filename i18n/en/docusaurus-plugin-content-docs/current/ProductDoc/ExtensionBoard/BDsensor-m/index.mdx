# BDsensor-m

    The BD sensor is a distance sensor that can be used with 3D printers to perform real-time rapid bed leveling and Z-axis adjustment.

    * Replaces Z-axis end stop
    * No need to raise or lower Z-axis during scanning, increases printing speed
    * XY movement scanning, can perform dense bed probing

## Connection

    * Power: 5V
    * Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
    * Connection: Mainboard (BDsensor will use the exp1 interface of the mainboard)
    * Heated Bed: Supports: Regular PEI, aluminum plate heated bed, and other metal surface heated beds. Does not support magnetic perforated heated beds or non-metal surface heated beds.

## Precautions

    * Klipper requires downloading the latest BD-SENSOR-m patch and reflashing the mainboard firmware.
    * Please place the emergency stop where it can be triggered at any time during debugging to avoid scratching the PEI.
    * Recommended bed scanning speed is 200!
    * Z-axis homing speed should not exceed 5.
