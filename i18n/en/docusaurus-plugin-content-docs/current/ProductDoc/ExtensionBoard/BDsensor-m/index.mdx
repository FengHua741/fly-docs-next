## Features

    * Replaces Z-axis endstop
    * No need to raise or lower the Z-axis during scanning, increasing printing speed
    * XY movement scanning, enabling intensive mesh bed probing

## Connection

    * Power: 5V
    * Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
    * Connection: Mainboard (BDsensor will use the exp1 interface of the mainboard)
    * Heated Bed: Supports: regular PEI, aluminum plate heated beds, and other metal surface heated beds, does not support magnet perforated beds and non-metal surface heated beds

## Notes

    * Klipper requires downloading both Klipper and the latest BD-SENSOR-m patch, and the mainboard firmware needs to be reflashed
    * Please keep the emergency stop within easy reach during debugging to avoid scratching the PEI
    * Recommended bed scanning speed is 200!
    * Z-axis homing speed should not exceed 5
