# BDsensor-m

    The BD sensor is a distance sensor that can be used with a 3D printer to perform rapid bed leveling and adjust the Z-axis in real time.

## Features
    * Installation Guide

    * Replaces Z-axis endstop
    * No need to raise or lower the Z-axis during scanning, increasing print speed
    * XY movement scanning, allows for dense mesh bed probing

## Connection

    * Power: 5V
    * Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
    * Connection: Mainboard (BDsensor will use the mainboard's exp1 interface)
    * Heated Bed: Supports: Regular PEI, aluminum plate heated beds, and other metallic surface heated beds, does not support magnetically perforated heated beds or non-metallic surface heated beds


## Precautions

    * Klipper requires downloading Klipper and the latest BD-SENSOR-m patch, and reflashing the mainboard firmware
    * Keep the emergency stop within reach during debugging to avoid scratching the PEI
    * Recommended bed scanning speed is 200!
    * Z-axis homing speed should not exceed 5
