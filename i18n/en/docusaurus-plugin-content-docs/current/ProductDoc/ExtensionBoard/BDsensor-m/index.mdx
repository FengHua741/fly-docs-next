    * Replaces Z-axis limit switch
    * No need to raise or lower the Z-axis during scanning, improving print speed
    * XY movement scanning enables dense mesh bed probing

## Connection

    * Power: 5V
    * Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
    * Connection: Mainboard (BDsensor uses the mainboard's exp1 interface)
    * Heated Bed: Supports: regular PEI, aluminum heated bed, and other metal surfaces. Does not support magnetic perforated beds and non-metallic surfaces.

## Precautions

    * Klipper requires downloading both Klipper and the latest BD-SENSOR-m patch, and the mainboard firmware needs to be reflashed
    * During debugging, keep the emergency stop within easy reach to prevent scratching the PEI
    * Recommended scanning speed is 200!
    * Z-axis homing speed should not exceed 5
