# BDsensor-m

BD sensor is a distance sensor that can be used in conjunction with 3D printers to perform real-time rapid bed leveling and adjust the z-axis.

* Replace z-axis limit
* No need to lift the z-axis during scanning, improving print speed
* XY movement scanning, capable of dense mesh bed detection

## Connection

* Power: 5V
* Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
* Connection: Mainboard (BDsensor will use the mainboard's exp1 interface)
* Heatbed: Supported: Ordinary PEI, aluminum plate heatbed and other metal surface heatbeds, not supported: magnet-drilled heatbeds and non-metallic surface heatbeds

## Precautions

* Klipper needs to download the latest BD-SENSOR-m patch and the Klipper firmware, and the mainboard firmware needs to be reflashed
* During debugging, please place the emergency stop somewhere that can be triggered at any time to avoid scratching the PEI
* Suggested bed scanning speed is 200!
* Z-axis homing speed is not recommended to exceed 5
