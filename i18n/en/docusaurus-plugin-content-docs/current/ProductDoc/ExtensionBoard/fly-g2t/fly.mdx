# Instructions for Using the FLY Host Computer

## Precautions:

    * Ensure that the host computer is powered off before installing the extension board.
    * Avoid using the extension board in humid or dusty environments.
    * When installing the screen, be careful not to plug or unplug it while powered on and pay attention to the direction of the screen cable to avoid damage.
    * When installing the fan, pay attention to the current and voltage specifications of the fan to avoid damage.
    * The FLY host computer can only use the middle RS232 interface, FAN port and FPC screen interface!!!
    * The G2T host computers that can be used in the FLY host computer are `PI V2`, `C8`, `PRO X10`
    * `Gemini` series and `PI V1` cannot be used

## Installing G2T

    * Below is a reference

## Using the Onboard RS232 Connection Tool Version Method

    * After the FLY host computer is updated with the latest system, you need to access **host computer's IP+:9999**
    * The FLY host computer can only use the middle RS232 interface, FAN port and FPC screen interface!!!
    * Find **UART1** in the system settings and save and restart

    * Below is the reference configuration

        ```cfg
        [mcu] 
        serial: /dev/ttyS1
        baud: 250000
        restart_method:command
        ```

## Using the Onboard 5VFAN

            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ExtensionBoard/fly-g2t/img/fan.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />

        ```cfg
        [mcu host]         
        serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu 

        [temperature_sensor FLY Pi]
        sensor_type: temperature_host

        [temperature_fan core_fan]      # Host computer cooling fan
        pin: host:gpiochip1/gpio102     # Host computer fan pin
        max_power: 1.0
        sensor_type: temperature_host   # Set as the main control temperature of the host computer
        control:watermark               # Control method
        target_temp: 48                 # Host computer cooling fan start temperature
        min_temp: 0                     # Minimum temperature, an error will be reported below this temperature
        max_temp: 90                    # Maximum temperature, an error will be reported above this temperature
        off_below: 0.10
        kick_start_time: 0.50
        max_speed: 0.8                  # Maximum speed, 80% of full power operation
        min_speed: 0.3                  # Minimum speed, 30% of full power operation

        ```

## Screen Usage Method

    * After the FLY host computer is updated with the latest system, you need to access **host computer's IP+:9999**
        * fly-tft-v2-c is a 3.5 inch TFT capacitive screen selection
        * fly-tft-v2-r is a 3.5 inch TFT resistive screen selection
