## Product Features

* Compatibility: Supports multiple versions of the Raspberry Pi, including Raspberry Pi Zero/3B/3B+/4B, etc.
* UART to RS232: Provides stable serial communication, allowing the Raspberry Pi to exchange data with other hardware devices through the RS232 interface.
* SPI capacitive touchscreen: The TFT-V2 capacitive screen connected through the FPC interface provides intuitive touch operation, suitable for applications that require a graphical user interface, such as klipperscreen, etc.
* 5V fan support: Integrates a 5V fan interface, which can connect fans for heat dissipation to ensure the stability of the host computer during long-term operation or high-load conditions.
* Plug-and-play design: The expansion board is designed to be easy to install, directly plugged into the host computer, without the need for additional wiring or complex configuration.
* Compact size: The expansion board has a reasonable size and will not take up too much space, making it convenient to integrate into various projects.

## Product Specifications

* Communication interface: UART to RS232
* Display interface: SPI to FPC interface
* Fan power supply: 5V
* Compatibility: Raspberry Pi Zero/3B/3B+/4B, FLY Pi V2, etc.

## Precautions

:::warning Precautions

* When using the RS232 connection tool board, be sure to `common ground` with the host computer!!!!!!!

:::

* Ensure that the host computer has been turned off before installing the expansion board.
* Avoid using the expansion board in humid or dusty environments.
* When installing the screen, be careful not to plug or unplug it while powered on and pay attention to the direction of the screen cable to avoid damage.
* When installing the fan, be aware of the current and voltage specifications of the fan to avoid damage.
