# BDsensor

BD sensor is a distance sensor that can be used in conjunction with 3D printers to perform real-time rapid bed leveling and adjust the z-axis.

## Features

* Replace z-axis limit switch
* No need to lift the z-axis during scanning, improving print speed
* XY movement scanning, capable of dense bed detection

## Connection

* Power: 5V
* Firmware: Klipper/Marlin
* Connection: Toolboard/Mainboard (BDsensor will use a servo port and a limit switch port)
* Hotbed: Ordinary PEI, aluminum plate hotbed and other metal surface hotbeds, does not support magnet-drilled hotbeds and non-metallic surface hotbeds

## Precautions

* Klipper needs to download the latest BD-SENSOR patch and the Klipper firmware, and the mainboard firmware needs to be reflashed
* During debugging, please place the emergency stop in a place that can be triggered at any time to avoid scratching the PEI
* The bed scanning speed is recommended to be 200!
* The z-axis homing speed is not recommended to exceed 5
