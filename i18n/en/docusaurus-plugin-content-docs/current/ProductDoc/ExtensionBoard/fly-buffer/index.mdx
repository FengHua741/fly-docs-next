# Introduction

# LLL Filament Buffer Usage

    The LLL filament buffer is a device specially designed for remote filament feeding of 3D printers, aiming to simplify the loading and unloading operations of filaments. The buffer is equipped with two buttons, one for feeding and one for retracting, allowing users to perform electric feeding and retracting operations.

### Buffer Function:

    When the extruder of a 3D printer feeds filament and pulls the filament spool at the far end, the buffer will detect this action and automatically send a section of filament towards the hot end. Each time a pull occurs, the buffer will repeat this feeding operation. This can effectively reduce the extruder's pull on the filament, maintain the stability of the extruder's thrust, and thus improve the stability of the print quality.

### Filament Out Detection Function:

    The buffer is equipped with an inbuilt filament out detector. When it detects that there is no filament in the buffer, it will send a signal to the 3D printer to pause printing. To use this function, you need to connect the signal pin and modify the configuration of the 3D printer. However, the buffer function can be used directly without modifying the configuration.

    Through the above functional design, the LLL filament buffer not only simplifies filament operations but also improves the stability and print quality of the 3D printing process.

* Please note that the function can only be used after the filament is connected; otherwise, the motor can only be controlled by the buttons.
