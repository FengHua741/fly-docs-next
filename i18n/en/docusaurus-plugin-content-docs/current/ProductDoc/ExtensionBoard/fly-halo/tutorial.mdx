# User Manual

## Precautions

    * The device must be connected to the internet for the first use. If your WIFI cannot connect to the internet, halo will not be able to obtain the configuration for the first startup.
    * All settings on the settings page will only take effect after clicking **Save Settings** and restarting the device.
    * The jam detection function is disabled by default and can only be accessed by swiping up from the homepage after enabling it in the settings and restarting.
    * The shutdown function after printing is disabled by default and can be enabled in the settings.
    * Buttons to cancel or pause printing in all pop-ups must be long-pressed; a single click is ineffective (to prevent accidental touches).
    * The Host service on the system services page refers to the host computer.
    * Do not attempt to replace the main control chip or FLASH chip when using official firmware.

    :::tip

    * Note: If your `moonraker.conf` configuration file exceeds 4MB, you may not be able to use it normally. If anomalies occur, please reduce the size of the `moonraker.conf` configuration file.

    :::

## System Firmware Update

    * halo version updates are divided into full updates and OTA incremental updates.
        * Full update: Involves significant upgrades to the underlying system and requires using USB to burn the full firmware package.
        * Incremental update: Normal OTA upgrade, check for updates on the device information page.
