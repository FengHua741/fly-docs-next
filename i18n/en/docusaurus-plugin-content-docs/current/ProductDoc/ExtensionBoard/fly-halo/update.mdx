## Incremental Upgrade (OTA)

    * On the Halo device information page, the version number can be clicked to check for updates. If there are available updates, a message will pop up, and you can click Update to start the upgrade. Do not power off during the process and wait for the progress to reach 100% before it automatically restarts.


## Full Upgrade (USB)

    * If a full upgrade firmware is released, you need to use a USB cable to connect Halo to the computer for upgrading.
    :::tip

    * Your original settings will not be retained during a full upgrade, and all settings will be restored to default.
