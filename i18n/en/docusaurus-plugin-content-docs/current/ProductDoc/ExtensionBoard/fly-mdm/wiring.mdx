# Wiring Diagram

:::danger Notice
    - The input power supply only supports DC5V. When wiring, make sure to distinguish between positive and negative poles, and the wiring process must be performed in a power-off state. Confirm that the wiring is correct before powering on; any losses caused by incorrect wiring will not be the responsibility of our company.
