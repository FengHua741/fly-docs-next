# FLY VoltUp Power

The FLY-VoltUp Power boost module is specifically designed for high-voltage drive, allowing users to achieve high-voltage drive without the need to purchase an additional high-voltage power supply, which helps to save space when designing 3D printers.

## Product Features

* Output power supply of 48V/60V selectable
* Onboard fan port, and comes with a fixed 4010 fan, the output voltage is the same as the input voltage
* Dual power interface expansion: Provides a power interface, allowing users to expand two power outputs at the same time, and can individually specify a power output of 48V or 60V
* Easy to install: Adopt standard size design, suitable for various environments, no need for additional driver installation.
* Compact size: The expansion board size is reasonable and will not occupy too much space, making it convenient to integrate into various projects.

## Product Specifications:

* Power interface: 12V/24V
* Output interface: Two selectable power supplies 48V/60V (selected by jumper cap)
* Fan interface: Two XH2.54 2P VCC FAN

## Precautions:

* Disconnect the power and turn off all devices before installation
* When outputting 48V, the maximum motor current can be set to 2A, while when outputting 60V, the maximum motor current can be set to 1A
* The voltage of the two VCC FAN interfaces is consistent with the power input, and the output voltage is the same as the power voltage
* The module reserves the fixing holes for the 4010 fan, and because the boost module generates a lot of heat, a fan must be equipped for heat dissipation
* Built-in reverse connection protection chip to prevent damage to parts due to customer operation errors.
* Do not insert the voltage selection jumper cap at the same time to avoid damaging components.
* Correctly connect the positive and negative poles to avoid damaging components.
