This expansion board provides a full set of features optimized for 3D printers. 12-24V DC power supply ensures stable power supply, which is crucial for precise control and continuous operation of 3D printers. Support for FLY-TFT and Fly-HDMI screen FPC connection provides a more convenient wiring method. The CAN port allows direct connection between host machine and slave machine, which is a currently popular approach.
