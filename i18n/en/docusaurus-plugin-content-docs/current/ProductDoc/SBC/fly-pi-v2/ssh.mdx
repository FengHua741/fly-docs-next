# Connect to Host Computer via SSH

* You can use **serial port** or **WiFi** to connect to the device.
* Please prepare **MobaXterm_Personal** or other **SSH terminal tools** in advance.
* Please ensure that the SD card or M2WE has burned a system that matches the host computer.
* **If the host computer cannot start normally, please remove all peripherals such as drivers, limit switches, fans, etc.!**

:::warning Note
- If this is the first time you are starting your host computer, you must use the **serial port connection** to connect to the host computer's SSH.
- When compiling firmware, you must use the **WiFi connection** to the host computer's SSH for easier firmware compilation and burning!
