# Connect to Host Computer via SSH

* You can use **serial port** or **WiFi** to connect to the device.
* Please prepare in advance **MobaXterm_Personal** or other **SSH terminal tools**.
* Please ensure that the SD card or M2WE has been burned with a system **compatible with the host computer**.
* **If the host computer cannot start up normally, please remove all external devices such as drivers, limiters, fans, etc.!**

:::warning Note
- If this is the first time you are starting your host computer, be sure to use the **serial port connection to the host computer SSH**!
- When compiling firmware, be sure to use the **WiFi connection to the host computer SSH** for easier firmware compilation and burning!
- The operations for connecting to SSH on the `FLYOS-Armbian` system and the `FLYOS-FAST` system are different, so choose the corresponding tutorial based on the system you have burned!!
