## System Introduction

* FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight Linux system, deeply customized for 3D printing, with fast boot speed, taking only 30 seconds to start. Supports all series of Fly host platforms.
* Optimized kernel to improve the real-time response performance of Klipper.
* Optimized file system to prevent system damage caused by direct power failure.
* Pre-installed services including Klipper, RRF, Mainsail, Fluidd, Moonraker, KlipperScreen, etc.
* Supports switching between Klipper and RRF systems.
* Supports one-click online switching between Mainsail and Fluidd.
* Supports USB disk printing.
* With KPPM module, it can achieve power-off resume printing.
* Supports presetting default language and printer name for front-end UIs like Fluidd.
* More OEM customization functions: such as setting up startup logos, preset configuration files, hiding Mainsail tab pages, etc., please contact us.

## Preparation

1. Download system image
    - Image link: [Piv2 system image download](https://g-ofpa1390.coding.net/public-artifacts/3D-Printers/flyos-fast/FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe/version/50907014/overview "Click this link to jump") (only supports Windows).  
    - Image link: [Piv2 system image download](https://g-ofpa1390.coding.net/public-artifacts/3D-Printers/flyos-fast/FlyOS-Fast-H5.7z/version/50907002/overview "Click this link to jump") (supports Windows, MacOS, Linux).

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/img/flyos-fast_download.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />


2. Download burning tool, the tutorial will use `Rufus` as an example. In fact, other tools can be used, such as `Etcher`, `Win32 Disk Imager`, etc.
    - Rufus download address: [Click Download Chinese](https://rufus.ie/zh/#download) or [Click Download English](https://rufus.ie/en/#download) (only supports Windows).
    - Etcher download address: [Click Download](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) (supports Windows, MacOS, Linux).
    - Win32 Disk Imager download address: [Click Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) (only supports Windows).

3. The tutorial will use `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe` as an example.

4. Extract the system image file to get the `.img` file.
    - Double-click or right-click to open `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe`, wait for a few seconds, and a window will pop up (if the system prompts that it is unsafe, choose "More information" -> "Run").
    - You can choose the extraction directory, then click the `Extract` button, and wait for the extraction to complete.
    
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/ext1.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

    - After the extraction is completed, a `FlyOS-Fast-H5-vx.x.x.img` file will be generated in the extraction directory. `x.x.x` is the system version number.

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="TF" label="Burn to TF Card" default>

            1. - The TF card used for burning needs to be larger than 4G, it is recommended to use a SanDisk 32GB C10 or higher TF card (tests found that many cheap cards cannot start after being burned).
               - The TF card used for burning needs to be inserted into a SD card reader, then insert the reader into the computer.
            2. Open `Rufus`, select the device. The selected device should display a capacity consistent with the burned card inserted into the computer.  
            
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash1.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    
            3. Select the image file, click the `Select` button on the right side of the `Boot selection` option, and select the `.img` file after decompression.
            4. After selecting the image file, the `Boot selection` option will change to the filename of the image file.
            
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

    :::warning
    * The FLY host needs to use the `M2WE` or `2.4G WiFi` module, otherwise WiFi cannot be used.
    * Please note that the host does not support WiFi with Chinese names, and does not support dual-band WiFi combining 2.4G and 5G.
    :::
    * The red arrow points to the WiFi antenna interface.
    * The WiFi antenna port is `ipex1`.
    * Please install the antenna on PI V2, otherwise poor signal may cause inability to connect to the router.
