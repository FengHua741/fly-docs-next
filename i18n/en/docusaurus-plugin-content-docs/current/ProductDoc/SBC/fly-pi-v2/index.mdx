# Introduction

We are pleased to release the new FLY-Pi V2 mainboard. This board has the same installation dimensions as the Raspberry Pi and can replace the Raspberry Pi as a mainboard, featuring 1GB of onboard DDR3 memory, allowing it to run a full LINUX desktop (based on Armbian custom optimization). The board can be used with Klipper and RRF firmware, and even runs the Klipper screen when using the SHT tool board.
The purpose of designing this mainboard is to make it easier for customers to use Klipper firmware or RRF firmware. We have optimized the LINUX system image to be more suitable for 3D printers, with simpler operation and installation, making it easy for beginners with some basic knowledge to quickly learn how to use it. Compared to other mainboard boards, it reduces learning costs, allowing you to focus more on enjoying the joy of 3D printing (buying a package with an SD card pre-installed with Klipper firmware, power-on ready, saving time and effort).

## Features

* Same form factor as Raspberry Pi 3B and 4B
* CPU: High-performance Allwinner H5 chip, quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53
* GPU: High-performance 6-core Mali 450, pixel fill rate greater than 2.7gpixel/s
* RAM: 1GB DDR3 (shared with GPU) (512+512)
* ROM: Supports up to 128GB SD card
* Peripherals: Spi x2, UART x2, USB x4 (USB 2.0 x3, OTG x1), Micro HDMI x1, Eth x1 (100M), CAN (onboard USB-to-CAN module, i.e., onboard UTOC)
* Interfaces: Onboard M.2 interface, expandable WIFI, eMMC, etc. (proprietary protocol, do not connect non-FLY π dedicated M.2 devices)
* 40Pin interface, compatible with Raspberry Pi
* Supports 12-24V DC power supply, more stable power supply
*预留了一个5V风扇ZH1.5接口
* Pre-installed with klipper, moonraker, mainsail, fulidd, klipper-screen, Crowsmest, resonance compensation plugins numpy and FLY-Tools, no need for complex operations like changing sources, making it easier for beginners (requires purchase of TF card or M2WE)
