# Onboard 5V Fan Interface

## Wiring of the Onboard 5V Fan
    * The Pi-V2 has a controllable 5V interface for main control cooling, and the wiring method is as follows:

## Commands to Execute Before Adding Configuration via SSH
```cfg
wget https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/mirrors/fly/linux-dtb-current-fly-sunxi64_3.3.5_arm64.deb && sudo dpkg -i linux-dtb-current-fly-sunxi64_3.3.5_arm64.deb
sudo reboot
```

## Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]                      # FlyOS has already generated the Linux MCU for you, just define it to use            
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu 

    [temperature_sensor FLY-Pi]      # Host machine temperature
    sensor_type: temperature_host


    [temperature_fan core_fan]      # Host machine cooling fan
    pin: host:gpiochip1/gpio103     # Host machine fan pin
    max_power: 1.0
    sensor_type: temperature_host   # Set to the temperature of the host machine main controller
    control:watermark               # Control method
    target_temp: 48                 # Temperature at which the host machine cooling fan starts
    min_temp: 0                     # Lowest temperature, below this will cause an error
    max_temp: 90                    # Highest temperature, above this will cause an error
    off_below: 0.10
    kick_start_time: 0.50
    max_speed: 0.8                  # Maximum speed, 80% of full power operation
    min_speed: 0.3                  # Minimum speed, 30% of full power operation
    ```
