:::warning Warning
    * The FLY host machine requires the use of an `M2WE` module, a `2.4G WiFi` module, or a `Linux driver-free USB wireless network card`. Otherwise, WiFi cannot be used.
    * Please note that the host machine does not support `WiFi` with Chinese names, nor does it support `2.4G and 5G dual-band combined WiFi`.
    * If you are using a `mini pad` or `lite2/lite2.1`, please ignore this warning.
