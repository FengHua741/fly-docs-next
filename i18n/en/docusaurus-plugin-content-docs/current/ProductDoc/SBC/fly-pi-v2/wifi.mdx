:::warning Warning
    * The FLY host computer needs to use the `M2WE` module or the `2.4G WIFI` module or the `Linux driver-free USB wireless network card`, otherwise WiFi cannot be used.
    * Please note that the host computer does not support WiFi with Chinese names, and does not support `2.4G and 5G dual-band combined WiFi`.
    * If it is a `mini pad` or `lite2/lite2.1`, please ignore this warning.
