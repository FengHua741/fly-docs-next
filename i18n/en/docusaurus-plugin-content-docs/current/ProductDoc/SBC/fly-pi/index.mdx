# Introduction

We are excited to release the new FLY-π mainboard. This board can replace the Raspberry Pi as the main controller and runs with 1GB of onboard DDR3 memory, allowing it to run a full LINUX desktop (based on Armbian custom optimization). The board can be used with Klipper and RRF firmware, and even run the Klipper screen when using the SHT tool board.

The purpose of designing this main controller is to make it easier for customers to use Klipper firmware or RRF firmware. We have optimized the LINUX system image to be more suitable for 3D printers, with simpler operation and installation. Even beginners with a little foundation can learn to use it quickly. Compared to other main controller boards, it saves learning costs, allowing you to focus more on enjoying the fun of 3D printing (buying a package with an SD card pre-installed with Klipper firmware, plug-and-play, saving time and effort). Installation is also simpler; even beginners with a little foundation can learn to use it quickly. Compared to other main controller boards, it saves learning costs, allowing you to focus more on enjoying the fun of 3D printing (buying a package with an SD card pre-installed with Klipper firmware, plug-and-play, saving time and effort).
