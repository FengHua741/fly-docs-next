## Install Antenna

    1. Install the antenna for `M2WE` or `2.4G WiFi` module
    :::warning
    * The FLY host machine requires the use of `M2WE` or `2.4G WIFI` modules, otherwise WiFi cannot be used
    * Please note that the host does not support WIFI with Chinese names, and does not support dual-band (2.4G and 5G) combined WIFI
    :::
    * The red arrow points to the WIFI antenna interface
    * The WIFI antenna port is `ipex1`
    * Please install the antenna on the M2WE, otherwise it may fail to connect to the router due to poor signal

    :::tip
    - After the system card is installed, you can proceed to the next step, connecting to the host via SSH
    :::

    2. Power on the host.  
    **At this point, your host is already powered on!!!**  
    Please proceed to the next step: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/ssh">SSH Connect to Host</Button>
