## Driver Installation

### Main Board Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and current is adjusted by regulating the potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers, which require referring to the manufacturer's provided subdivision configuration table and then setting the subdivision via the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most commonly used drivers in this mode include TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main controller via UART asynchronous serial communication, and settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can be configured by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most commonly used drivers in this mode include TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc., and settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can also be configured by modifying the configuration file.

----

### Driver Installation

* Drivers need to be checked accordingly before installation to avoid damaging the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY driver:** If you do not use the zero-point return function without limit, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if you want to use the zero-point return function without limit, please set the DIP switch to ON.

    :::danger

    * **Note!!! When installing the driver module, make sure the insertion direction is correct, i.e., the EN pin should be on the top left, otherwise it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!!! Make sure to attach a heatsink to the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of which manufacturer produces the two-phase stepper motor, its final appearance corresponds to four wires. Regardless of the color, black, white, green, yellow, etc., they correspond to four wires. Therefore, we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, we do not need to know which one is Group A and which one is Group B; mainly, we just need to determine one group, and in the configuration, modify the motor direction.
:::

* In a 3D printer, the most commonly used is a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, whose principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the sequence of stepper motor wires:
    * Connect any two phase wires, manually rotate the motor shaft, if there is obvious resistance, then the two phase wires belong to the same group. Conversely, they do not belong to the same group, and another pair of phase wires needs to be tested.
    * Use a multimeter, set to continuity mode, test any two phase wires of the stepper motor, if they are connected, then they belong to the same group; conversely, they do not belong to the same group, and another pair of phase wires needs to be tested.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention to not connecting the input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC bed:** When connecting a DC bed to the onboard MOS, please pay attention to the power usage, and the maximum current for the DC bed should not exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module for the bed to avoid irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Temperature Sensor Wiring

### Introduction to Temperature Sensor Types

* The wiring method for the temperature sensor is as follows. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a regular NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

## Fan Wiring

* **Fan Wiring**

    :::tip

    Voltage selection for fans. Simply short the corresponding voltage pins with a jumper cap, as shown in the figure below. Note: The jumper configurations within the yellow boxes are identical.
    Note!!! Choosing the wrong fan voltage may damage the fan or MOS module.

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC). Generally, in a 3D printer, it is recommended to use **Normally Closed (NC)**. This way, when there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, the system will promptly report an error, avoiding unnecessary collisions and preventing damage to the printer.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring

### Metal Proximity Switch Wiring

* VORON officially recommends using Omron Omron TL-Q5MC (previously the official recommendation was PL08N, which has the same principle but different detection distances) sensors for bed leveling. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/wiring/pl08.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has five wires in total, three in the first group responsible for supplying power to the sensor and controlling the probeâ€™s retraction and extension, the second group is ground and signal lines, outputting limit signals. When wiring BL-touch, carefully verify the wire sequence, incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!! The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/wiring/bltouch.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with low cost and stable performance, making it highly cost-effective, and is recommended. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.
* Project address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project address, click to jump")

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/wiring/klicky.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a Z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire tool head moves to trigger the optical switch, offering better precision than conventional limit switches, and can be used with almost all printing platforms available on the market.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, some versions using **24V** have a certain probability of burning out the Tap sensor, this is not a problem with the Fly product, but a design flaw in Voron Tap, please note!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following diagram shows the wiring method for the FLY mini12864. For screens from other manufacturers, please consult the respective manufacturer. Reversing or miswiring the Mini12864 screen may cause the host computer to fail to connect to the MCU. If you could previously connect the MCU through the motherboard using the mini12864 screen, but now cannot connect after using the mini12864, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!
