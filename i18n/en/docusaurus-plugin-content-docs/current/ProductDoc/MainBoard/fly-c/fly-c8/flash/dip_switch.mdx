# DIP Switch Introduction

:::tip
FLY c8 connects to the host machine via the DIP switch; if the position of the DIP switch is incorrect, it cannot be used normally.
:::

:::danger Note
Please note that the DIP switch needs to be set to the specified position to connect to the host machine normally.

## Connecting Onboard Host Machine

    * Move DIP switches `1` and `2` to the right to connect the downstream device to the host machine via the built-in USB.
    * Move DIP switches `3` and `4` to the left, otherwise it will affect the connection between the downstream device and the host machine.

    * After moving the DIP switches in this way, the downstream USB port will be occupied by the downstream device. Please do not connect other devices.
