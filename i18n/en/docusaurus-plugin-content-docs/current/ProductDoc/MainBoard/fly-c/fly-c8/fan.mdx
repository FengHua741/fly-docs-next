## Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]                      # FlyOS has already generated the Linux MCU for you, define to use           
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu 

    [temperature_sensor FLY-Ï€]      # Host machine temperature
    sensor_type: temperature_host


    [temperature_fan core_fan]      # Host machine cooling fan
    pin: host:gpiochip1/gpio103     # Host machine fan pin
    max_power: 1.0
    sensor_type: temperature_host   # Set to host machine main control temperature
    control:watermark               # Control method
    target_temp: 48                 # Host machine cooling fan start temperature
    min_temp: 0                     # Minimum temperature, below this temperature will result in an error
    max_temp: 90                    # Maximum temperature, above this temperature will result in an error
    off_below: 0.10
    kick_start_time: 0.50
    max_speed: 0.8                  # Maximum speed, at full power operation's 80%
    min_speed: 0.3                  # Minimum speed, at full power operation's 30%
