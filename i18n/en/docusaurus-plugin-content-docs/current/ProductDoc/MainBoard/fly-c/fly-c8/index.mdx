# FLY C8


    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/c8.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />

## Product Features

    * Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ series STM32F407VGT6 main control chip with a frequency of 168MHz
    * Equipped with TMC drivers in SPI and UART working modes
    * Equipped with a DIAG function pin, enabling zero-point homing by simply plugging in a jumper cap
    * Digital fan with selectable voltages of 24V, 12V, and 5V, eliminating the need for a voltage drop module
    * New Flash writing method, allowing direct firmware updates for the main board via FLY-Tools
    * Multi-channel power management; if ports, limit switches, or drivers short circuit, it will not affect the host machine operation
    * Reserved RGB interface support with selectable voltages (12V, 5V)
    * Reserved SPI interface, allowing customers to connect external acceleration sensors for acceleration compensation
    * Support for one-wire connection between TFT screen and HDMI screen
    * The system pre-installs klipper, moonraker, mainsail, fulidd, klipper-screen, Crowsmest, resonance compensation plugins numpy and FLY-Tools, without the need for complex operations like changing sources, making it easier for beginners (requires purchasing an TF card or M2WE)
