Not recommended!!! A conventional host system, relatively open, but with poor stability!

## System Burning Preparation

    * Card reader
    * One TF card, the capacity must not be less than 16GB or not more than 128GB TF card, and the transfer speed of the TF card must be Class10 or above
    * Download the corresponding <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ResDownload/system-img/fly-c8">system image</Button>

## System Burning

:::info
TF card burning and burning to M2WE through TF card only need to use one of the burning methods
:::

:::info
* If the machine is installed with M2WE and memory card, the system will boot from the memory card by default
* It is recommended to burn the system using the TF card. Burning through USB to M2W may fail due to driver compatibility issues. It is recommended to directly use [Memory Card Burning to M2WE](https://mellow-next.klipper.cn/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/fly-os)
* Please note whether the downloaded system image corresponds. If it does not correspond, the system cannot start

## Installing the System Card

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="TF" label="Installing the TF Card on C8" default>
            * After burning the system to the TF card, the TF card needs to be connected to C8 here, otherwise the system cannot start

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="M2WE" label="Installing the M2WE Card on C8">
            * Please note that if there is a TF card, the system will boot from the TF card by default
            * Please note that the screws need to be fixed with a 1.27 hex screwdriver
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/m2we.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" />

    </Tabs>

## Installing the Antenna

    1. Install the antenna for `M2WE` or `2.4G WiFi` module
    :::warning
    * FLY host machine needs to use `M2WE` or `2.4G WIFI` module, otherwise WiFi cannot be used
    * Note that the host machine does not support Chinese-named WIFI, and does not support 2.4G and 5G dual-band integration WIFI
    :::
    * The red arrow points to the WIFI antenna interface
    * The WIFI antenna port is `ipex1`
    * Please install the antenna on the M2WE, otherwise the connection to the router may fail due to poor signal
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/wifi.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 

    :::tip
    - After completing the installation of the system card, you can proceed to the next step and connect to the host machine via SSH
    :::

    2. Power on the host machine.  
    **At this point, your host machine has already started up!!!**  
    Please proceed to the next step: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/ssh">SSH Connection to the Host Machine</Button>
