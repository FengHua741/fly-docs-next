    <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/DebugDoc/baodian/host/">Host Newcomer Operation Guide</Button>

## Preparations Before System Writing

    * Card reader
    * One TF card with a capacity of no less than 16GB or no more than 128GB, the transmission speed of the TF card must be Class10 or above
    * Download the corresponding <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ResDownload/system-img/fly-c8">system image</Button>
    * Download the required <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ResDownload/auxiliary_software/">writing tool</Button>

## System Writing

:::info
TF card writing and writing to M2WE via TF card only require using one of the writing methods.
:::

:::info
* If the machine is installed with M2WE and memory card, the system will boot from the memory card by default.
* It is recommended to use TF card to write the system for M2WE. Using USB to burn into M2W may fail due to driver compatibility issues. It is recommended to directly use [Memory Card Burning to M2WE](https://mellow-next.klipper.cn/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/fly-os).
* Please pay attention to whether the downloaded system image corresponds. If it does not correspond, the system cannot start.

        <TabItem value="TF" label="Installing the TF Card on C8" default>
            * After burning the system to the TF card, the TF card needs to be connected to the C8 here, otherwise the system cannot start

        <TabItem value="M2WE" label="Installing the M2WE Card on C8">
            * Please note that if there is a TF card, the system will boot from the TF card by default
            * Please note that hexagonal screwdriver with a diameter of 1.27mm is required to fix the screws

    </Tabs>

## Installing the Antenna

    1. Install the antenna for `M2WE` or `2.4G WiFi` module
    :::warning
    * FLY host machine requires `M2WE` or `2.4G WIFI` module to use WiFi
    * Please note that the host machine does not support Chinese-named WiFi and does not support dual-band (2.4G and 5G) WiFi
    :::
    * The red arrow points to the WiFi antenna interface
    * The WiFi antenna port is `ipex1`
    * Please install the antenna on M2WE, otherwise the signal may be poor and unable to connect to the router
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/img/wifi.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 

    :::tip
    - After the system card installation is completed, you can proceed to the next step and connect to the host machine via SSH
    :::

    2. Power on the host machine.  
    **Your host machine has already started up at this point!!!**  
    Please proceed to the next step: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c8/ssh">SSH Connection to Host Machine</Button>
