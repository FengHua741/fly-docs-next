# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator Light

    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other mainboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting to the mainboard power, the mainboard power light should show `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting

    :::danger Note

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * At least one light `3.3V` should remain on when powered only through TYPE-C.

    :::

    * If the `5V` light does not turn on after connecting the mainboard power and driver power, contact customer service for assistance.

## Driver

    * The mainboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Port

    * Pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, if 5V, GND, and S are connected incorrectly, it could damage the mainboard.
    * If using a two-wire connection, connect S and GND directly.
    * For PL08 and other proximity switches, an external diode must be added to the signal port to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V.
