* Please prepare a data cable with data transfer function. If the length is particularly long, it is recommended to use a data cable with a magnetic ring.
* Before searching for the ID, connect the tool board to the Gemini main board flashed with bridge firmware using an XT30 data cable.

## CAN Configuration and ID Search

* If you need to use CAN, ensure that the host machine has been configured for CAN.

---

:::danger Notice
Ensure the main board is properly connected to the host machine before proceeding with the following operations.
:::

:::warning
Ensure the CAN network of the host machine, the CAN rate of the bridge main board, and the rate of the CAN tool board are completely consistent.
:::

### Precautions Before Searching for Devices

* Before searching for the CAN ID, please first [connect to SSH](/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/index.mdx "click to jump").
* Ensure you are logged in via the network to SSH, not via serial port login.
* Ensure the UTOC is connected or the motherboard flashed with CAN bridge firmware, and the data cable connecting to the host machine has data transfer capability.

### Device Search

* After logging into the host machine, enter the command `lsusb` to search for devices. Several scenarios may occur:
    * If the prompt says the `ls` command is not found, you can enter the following command to install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install usbutils
        ```
    * If `lsusb` shows no reaction, this is a system issue, requiring a system replacement or using a normal system.
    * If the following information appears, confirm the presence of `1d50:606f`:
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/606f.webp').default} size="100%" align="left" />
* `1d50:606f` is the device required for this session. If there are multiple `1d50:606f`, it is recommended to exclude one to avoid affecting subsequent operations.
* If none are found, check whether the data cable is properly connected and whether the firmware is correctly flashed.

:::warning Notice
A `1d50:606f` must exist to search for the CAN ID.
:::

### CAN ID Search

* Enter the following command to search for the ID:
    ```bash
    python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
    ```
* If the ID appears and the `Application:` displays `Klipper`, then this ID can be used directly.
* If the `Application:` displays `CANBOOT` or `Katapult`, then the firmware needs to be flashed:
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/canbus-uuid.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />

### CAN Problem Collection

:::danger Notice
* If the CAN ID cannot be found, refer to the following document:
    <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/DebugDoc/faq/klipper_can">CAN Problem Collection</Button>
:::

### Filling the CAN ID into the Configuration

* Open the printer's web interface and find the `printer.cfg` under the configuration option in the left sidebar:
    * fluidd: `{…}`
    * mainsail: `Machine`
* After clicking into it, copy and paste the queried UUID into the `canbus_uuid:` field under the `[mcu]` node, save and restart to connect to the main board.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/fluidd-cfg.webp').default} size="50%" align="left" />
* If Klipper prompts that the firmware needs to be updated or reports an ADC error, this indicates that Klipper has successfully connected to the main board.

Notice: All IDs in the documentation are examples. Each main board's ID is different, so please modify and fill in according to the actual obtained ID.
