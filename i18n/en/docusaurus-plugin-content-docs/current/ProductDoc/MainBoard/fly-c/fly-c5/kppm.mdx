# Klipper Power Loss Resume Functionality

## Overview

- The Klipper power loss resume function refers to the ability of Klipper to automatically restore its printing status after being powered off and then powered on again.
- This feature requires the use of a safety shutdown module.
- It is not applicable for machines where the Z-axis will move when power is lost.

## Configuration

### Disable Power-off Shutdown
    :::danger Notice
    - The power-off shutdown must be disabled; otherwise, the power loss resume function cannot be used.
    - There is an automatic shutdown after saving progress in the power loss resume process.
    :::

- Enter the device's IP address in the browser's address bar, for example: `http://192.168.6.179`
- Access the configuration page
    - Open the device IP address in the browser, for example: `http://192.168.1.2/`
    - In fluidd, uncheck as shown on the left in the figure below -> `Hide hidden files and folders`.
    - In mainsail, check as shown on the right in the figure below -> `Show hidden files`.
    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/config1.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    - You can now see the `.flyos-config` folder. Inside this folder, there is a `sys-config.conf` file.
    - The `sys-config.conf` file is a symbolic link to the `config.txt` file in the removable disk `FlyOS-Conf`.

    - Open the `sys-config.conf` file and locate the configurations `shutdown_pin_state` and `shutdown_pin=`.
    - Add a `#` before these configurations.
    - Then save and close, and restart the system.

### plr.cfg Configuration File

- Find the `plr.cfg` file in the printer configuration page.
- Clear the content inside and paste the following configuration:

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]   
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu
    
    [power_loss_resume]
    power_pin: !host:gpiochip0/gpio260 # Shutdown pin of the safety shutdown module connected to PA21 pin on the host machine
    is_shutdown: True # Whether to execute shutdown operation, default is enabled
    paused_recover_z: -2.0 # Z movement distance during recovery if paused at shutdown, default is no movement
    start_gcode:
        # G-code to run before resuming print
        # All parameters saved before power loss can be accessed via {PLR}
        # Use M118 {PLR} to output all available parameters
        M118 Start Resuming Print: {PLR.print_stats.filename}
        M118 Interrupt Position: X:[{PLR.POS_X}] Y:[{PLR.POS_Y}] Z:[{PLR.POS_Z}] E:[{PLR.POS_E}]
        M140 S{PLR.bed.target}      ; Set bed temperature
        M104 S{PLR.extruder.target-10}  ; Set extruder temperature
        M109 S{PLR.extruder.target-10}  ; Wait until extruder reaches set temperature
        G91                             ; Relative coordinates
        G1 Z2 F100                      ; Lift Z, prepare for X,Y homing
        G90                             ; Absolute coordinates
        G28 X Y                         ; Home XY
        M140 S{PLR.bed.target}          ; Set bed temperature
        M104 S{PLR.extruder.target}     ; Set extruder temperature
        M190 S{PLR.bed.target}          ; Wait for bed to reach set temperature
        M109 S{PLR.extruder.target}     ; Wait for extruder to reach set temperature
        M83                             ; Relative extrusion
        # G1 E0.5 F400                  ; Extrude a bit
    layer_count: 2 # Number of layers to resume before executing layer_change_gcode
    layer_change_gcode:                
        # G-code to execute after resuming {layer_count} layers
        M118 Resume Print Speed
        M106 S{PLR.fan_speed}             ; Turn on cooling fan
        M220 S{PLR.move_speed_percent}    ; Set requested speed percentage
        M221 S{PLR.extrude_speed_percent} ; Set requested extrude speed percentage
    shutdown_gcode:
        # G-code to run before shutdown
        M118 Low Power Voltage, Shutting Down
        # M112 ; Emergency stop

    ```

    :::warning Note

    - The macros in the `start_gcode` above may need modification based on the specific machine's situation.

    :::

- After saving the above configuration file,
- Open the `printer.cfg` file and add the following content at the very beginning of the file:

    ```cfg

    [include plr.cfg]

    ```

- Click the top-right "Save and Restart" button to apply the changes.
- At this point, the Klipper power loss resume function has been configured.

## Testing

- Start printing any file. During the print process, click the "Emergency Stop" button to simulate a power outage.
- Click "Firmware Restart" again. Once Klipper reconnects normally,
- If a pop-up prompt appears on the webpage or KlipperScreen, it indicates that the power loss resume function is working correctly.
- Further testing with real power outages can be conducted afterward.
