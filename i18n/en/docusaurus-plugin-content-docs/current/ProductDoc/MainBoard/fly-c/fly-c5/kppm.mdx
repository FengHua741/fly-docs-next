# Power Loss Resume Function in Klipper

## Overview

- The power loss resume function in Klipper refers to the ability to automatically restore the printing state of Klipper after it has been powered off and then powered on again.
- This function requires the use of a safety shutdown module.
- It is not applicable for machines where the Z-axis will move when the power is cut.

## Configuration

### Disable Power Off Shutdown
    :::danger Note
    - You need to disable the power-off shutdown, otherwise the power loss resume function cannot be used.
    - The power loss resume function includes an automatic shutdown after saving progress.
    :::

- Enter the device's IP address in the browser's address bar, for example: `http://192.168.6.179`
- Access the configuration page
    - Open the device IP address in the browser, for example: `http://192.168.1.2/`
    - In fluidd, uncheck as shown in the left image -> `Filter hidden files and folders`.
    - In mainsail, check as shown in the right image -> `Show hidden files`.
    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/config1.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
        </td>
        <td>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    - At this point, you can see the `.flyos-config` folder. Inside this folder, there will be a `sys-config.conf` file.
    - The `sys-config.conf` file is a symbolic link to the `config.txt` configuration file in the removable disk `FlyOS-Conf`.

    - Open the `sys-config.conf` file and locate the configurations `shutdown_pin_state` and `shutdown_pin=`.
    - Add a # before these configurations.
    - Then save and close, and restart the system.

### plr.cfg Configuration File

- In the printer configuration page, find the `plr.cfg` file.
- Empty the content inside, then paste the following configuration into it.
- The content of the configuration file is as follows:

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]   
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu
    
    [power_loss_resume]
    power_pin: !host:gpiochip0/gpio260 # Shutdown pin of the safety shutdown module, connected to PA21 pin on the host machine
    is_shutdown: True # Whether to execute shutdown operation, default is enabled
    paused_recover_z: -2.0 # Z movement distance during recovery if the machine is paused during shutdown, default is no movement
    start_gcode:
        # G-code to execute before resuming print
        # All parameters saved before power loss can be accessed via {PLR}
        # Use M118 {PLR} to output all available parameters
        M118 Starting resume: {PLR.print_stats.filename}
        M118 Interruption position: X:[{PLR.POS_X}] Y:[{PLR.POS_Y}] Z:[{PLR.POS_Z}] E:[{PLR.POS_E}]
        M140 S{PLR.bed.target}      ; Set bed temperature
        M104 S{PLR.extruder.target-10}  ; Set extruder temperature
        M109 S{PLR.extruder.target-10}  ; Wait for extruder to heat up to set temperature
        G91                             ; Relative coordinates
        G1 Z2 F100                      ; Raise Z, prepare for X,Y homing
        G90                             ; Absolute coordinates
        G28 X Y                         ; Home XY
        M140 S{PLR.bed.target}          ; Set bed temperature
        M104 S{PLR.extruder.target}     ; Set extruder temperature
        M190 S{PLR.bed.target}          ; Wait for bed to heat up to set temperature
        M109 S{PLR.extruder.target}     ; Wait for extruder to heat up to set temperature
        M83                             ; Relative extrusion
        # G1 E0.5 F400                  ; Extrude a bit
    layer_count: 2 # Execute layer_change_gcode after resuming specified number of layers
    layer_change_gcode:                
        # G-code to execute after resuming {layer_count} layers
        M118 Resume print speed
        M106 S{PLR.fan_speed}             ; Turn on part cooling fan
        M220 S{PLR.move_speed_percent}    ; Set requested speed percentage
        M221 S{PLR.extrude_speed_percent} ; Set requested extrude speed percentage
    shutdown_gcode:
        # G-code to execute before shutdown
        M118 Low power voltage, shutting down
        # M112 ; Emergency stop

    ```

    :::warning Note

    - The `start_gcode` macro in the above configuration file may need modification based on the specific machine's actual situation.

    :::

- After saving the configuration file,
- Open the `printer.cfg` file and add the following content at the beginning of the file:

    ```cfg

    [include plr.cfg]

    ```

- Click the Save button in the top right corner and restart the system.
- The power loss resume function in Klipper is now configured.

## Testing

- Start printing any file. During the print process, click the `Emergency Stop` button to simulate a power failure.
- Click `Firmware Restart`, wait for Klipper to connect normally.
- If a pop-up prompt appears on the webpage or KlipperScreen, it indicates that the power loss resume function is working properly.
- You can continue testing with real power failure scenarios later.
