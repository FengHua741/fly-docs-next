# System Image Burning

## System Introduction
FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight Linux system customized specifically for 3D printing, supporting the entire series of Fly mainboards. Its features include:

- Fast boot with kernel optimization to ensure Klipper real-time performance
- Optimized file system to reduce the risk of failure to boot due to power loss
- 30-second fast startup of KlipperScreen
- Pre-installed services including Klipper, RRF, Mainsail, Fluidd, Moonraker, and KlipperScreen
- Support for switching between Klipper and RRF systems
- Support for online one-click switching between Mainsail and Fluidd
- Support for USB drive printing, power-off resume printing, and serial port screen
- Support for automatic firmware burning on startup (fly-c8, fly-geminiv3)
- Ability to pre-set default language and printer name for front-end UIs like Fluidd

For more OEM customization features (such as custom boot logo, preset configuration files, hiding Mainsail tabs, etc.), please contact us.

:::tip Note
This system is a lightweight customized system; the built-in klipper components and services are not official original versions and do not support user modifications or upgrades.

## System Burning Preparation

1. Prepare the TF card for burning:
    - Card reader
    - One TF card with a capacity of 16GB-128GB and a transmission speed of Class10 or higher.
    - It is recommended to use brand-name TF cards such as Kingston, SanDisk, Samsung, or Kioxia; avoid using generic TF cards!

2. Download the FLY-C5 system image: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://g-ofpa1390.coding.net/public-artifacts/3D-Printers/flyos-fast/packages">H618 System Image</Button>
    :::tip
    - The naming rule for the system file is: `FlyOS-Fast-[chip series]-[version number].img`, for example: `FlyOS-Fast-H5-v1.0.0.img`
    - For Windows systems, download the `.exe` file, which is a 7z self-extracting archive. After downloading, double-click it to extract and obtain the `.img` file (this can only be used on Windows systems to extract).
    - For other systems such as MacOS and Linux, download the `.7z` file, which is a 7z archive. After downloading, use tools that support the 7z format to extract and obtain the `.img` file.
    - Due to the large size of the system file, other compression formats and source images are temporarily unavailable for download.
    - This tutorial will introduce using the `.exe` file as an example.
    :::
    - Access the FlyOS-Fast artifact repository, select the compression format, and enter the file page
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl1.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Select the image version (default latest)
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl2.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click `File List`, then scroll the scrollbar to drag it to the right to display the download button
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl3.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click the download button to download the system image
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl4.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />


3. Download the burning tool. This tutorial will use `Rufus` as an example. In fact, other tools such as `Etcher` and `Win32 Disk Imager` can also be used.
    - Rufus download address: [Download Chinese](https://rufus.ie/zh/#download) or [Click Download English](https://rufus.ie/en/#download) (only supports Windows).
    - Etcher download address: [Click Download](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) (supports Windows, MacOS, Linux).
    - Win32 Disk Imager download address: [Click Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) (only supports Windows).

4. This tutorial will use `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe` as an example.

5. Extract the system image file to obtain the `.img` file.
    - Double-click or right-click to open `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe`, wait a few seconds, and a window will pop up (if the system prompts that it is unsafe, select "More Info" -> "Run").
    - You can choose the extraction directory, then click the `Extract` button, and wait for the extraction to complete.
    
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/ext1.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

    - After extraction, a `FlyOS-Fast-H5-vx.x.x.img` file will be generated in the extraction directory. `x.x.x` is the system version number.


6. Insert the prepared Class10 TF card into the card reader and connect it to the computer


## Burning the System

1. Open Rufus, select the device (the capacity should match the burn card)  
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

2. Select "Image File" under Boot Selection.

3. Click the "Select" button and select the `.img` file after extraction.

4. After selection, the Boot Selection displays the image file name.  
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash2.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />
    
5. Click "Start". If prompted to clear disk data, click "OK".  
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash3.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />

6. After burning is complete, the computer emits a prompt sound, and the progress bar shows "Ready".  
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash4.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

7. Do not remove the burn card after completion.

8. Open File Explorer to check if there is a named `FlyOS-Conf` USB drive or removable disk.  
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash5.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

9. Open `FlyOS-Conf`. If the two files shown below are present, the burn is successful, where `config.txt` is the system configuration file.
