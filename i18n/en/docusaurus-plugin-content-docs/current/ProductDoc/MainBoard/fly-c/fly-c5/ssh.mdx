# Connect to Host Computer via SSH

:::danger Note
- If this is the first time your host computer has booted after being flashed with an image, you must use `Serial Port Connection to Host Computer SSH`.
- During the first boot, do not connect any lines other than power and Type-C!!
- When compiling firmware, be sure to use `WiFi Connection to Host Computer SSH` for easier firmware compilation and flashing!
:::

* Before starting the connection, please download: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html ">SSH Software</Button>. Select `Installer edition` on the right to download.

        ## Use Serial Port to Connect to Host Computer SSH

       :::tip Note
        - Make sure the TF card or M2WE has been burned with the correct system and installed correctly on the FLY-C5.
        - The default username for the FLYOS-FAST system is `root`, and the default password is `mellow`.
       :::

        * Use a Type-C data cable to connect the FLY-C5 to the computer.

        * If the motherboard is connected to the computer normally, you can see the CH340 port in the Device Manager.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/pc-device-mgr.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />

        * Open `MobaXterm` and make the following settings. Select the port seen in the Device Manager.

        * Since FLYOS-FAST boots quickly, you will most likely see garbled text, as shown in the image below. This is normal, so don't worryâ€”just press Enter a few times.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/flyos-fast/img/flyos-fast_serial3.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

        :::warning Note 
        - The account for the FLYOS-FAST system is `root`, and the password is `mellow`.
        - The FLYOS-FAST system has only one account, `root`!!

        ## Use WiFi to Connect to Host Computer SSH
       :::tip Note
        - Make sure the host computer system has already **booted up properly**.
        - The default username for the FLYOS-FAST system is `root`, and the default password is `mellow`.
        - The **precondition** for connecting to the host computer SSH via WiFi is that your **host computer has already connected to the router and you know the host computer's IP**.
       :::

        * Use a UType-C data cable to connect the FLY-C5 to the computer.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/c5.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

        * Open MobaXterm, set it as shown in the image below. In the `Remote host` field, enter the IP of the host computer obtained during the serial port connection, or query the host computer's IP through the router backend.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/mobaxterm-1.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

        **Note: Here, the username `root` for the host computer should be entered in step 4.**
