# Connect to Host Computer via SSH

:::danger Note
- If this is the first boot after flashing your host computer, you must use `Serial Port Connection to Host Computer SSH`.
- During the first boot, do not connect any cables except for power and Type-C!!
- When compiling firmware, please use `WiFi Connection to Host Computer SSH` to facilitate firmware compilation and burning!
:::

* Before starting the connection, please download: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html ">SSH Software</Button>. Simply select the right side's `Installer edition` to download.

        ## Use Serial Port to Connect to Host Computer SSH

       :::tip Note
        - Please ensure that the TF card or M2WE has been burned with the correct system and correctly installed on the FLY-C5.
        - The default username for the FLYOS-FAST system is `root`, and the default password is `mellow`.
       :::

        * Use a Type-C data cable to connect the FLY-C5 to the computer.

        * If the motherboard is connected to the computer normally, you can see the CH340 port in the Device Manager.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/pc-device-mgr.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />

        * Open `MobaXterm` and set it up as shown below. Select the port seen in the Device Manager earlier.

        :::warning Note 
        - The account for the FLYOS-FAST system is `root`, and the password is `mellow`.

        ## Use WiFi to Connect to Host Computer SSH
       :::tip Note
        - Ensure that the host computer system has already **started normally**.
        - The default username for the FLYOS-FAST system is `root`, and the default password is `mellow`.
        - The prerequisite for connecting to the host computer SSH via WiFi is: Your **host computer has already connected to the router, and you know the host computer's IP**.
