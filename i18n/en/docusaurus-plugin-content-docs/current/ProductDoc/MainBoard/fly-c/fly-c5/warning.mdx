# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator Light

* When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting other mainboard power sources, at least two lights, `3.3V` and `5V`, should be on.
* After connecting the mainboard power source, the mainboard power light should illuminate `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting

:::danger Notice

* In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
* When powered only through TYPE-C, the `3.3V` light should remain constantly lit.

:::

* If the `5V` light does not illuminate after connecting the mainboard power and driver power, contact customer service for assistance.

## Driver

* The mainboard supports external drivers <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Tutorial</Button>

## Limit Switch Port

* Pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, if the 5V, GND, and S are connected incorrectly, it may cause damage to the mainboard.
* If using a two-wire connection, connect S and GND directly.
* PL08 and other proximity switches require an external diode on the signal port to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V.
