# USB Firmware Compilation

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <USB />

    * Press the `Q` key, when **Save configuration** appears, press `Y` again
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compilation, it will take some time
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output below is displayed, the compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```
## Confirm DFU Mode
    * Ensure the host machine can connect to the internet normally and that the data cable connecting the lower-level device to the host has data transmission capabilities.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the picture below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates a problem with the host system, and we are unable to help. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
        * If the instruction `lsusb` is not found, you can execute the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-micro/fly-micro4/flash/img/6177.webp').default} size="70%" align="center" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed, the suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. rp2040` has a judgment basis where `XX` means it is variable.
        * Some hosts may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
