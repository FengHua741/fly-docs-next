## Driver Installation

### Main Board Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and current is adjusted by regulating the potentiometer. Most commonly used drivers like A4988 and 8825 require consulting the manufacturer's provided subdivision configuration table and then setting the subdivision via the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode are: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main controller via UART asynchronous serial communication, and settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can be configured by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode are: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc., which can also configure settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* Drivers need to be checked accordingly before installation to avoid damaging the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY Driver:** If you do not use the zeroing function without limit switches, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if you want to use the zeroing function without limit switches, please set the DIP switch to ON.

    :::danger

    * **Warning!!! When installing the driver module, ensure the correct direction is inserted, i.e., the EN pin is on the top left, otherwise, it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!!! Ensure proper heat dissipation for the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of the manufacturer, two-phase stepper motors ultimately appear as four wires. No matter what color they are, black, white, green, yellow, they all correspond to four wires. Therefore, we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For two-phase four-wire stepper motors, we do not need to know which is Group A and which is Group B; mainly, we need to determine one group, and the motor direction can be modified in the configuration.
:::

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used are two-phase four-wire stepper motors, whose principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the wiring sequence of stepper motors:
    * Connect any two phase wires, turn the motor shaft by hand, and if there is significant resistance, these two wires are a pair. Conversely, they are not a pair, and other phase wires need to be tested.
    * Use a multimeter set to continuity mode to test any two phase wires of the stepper motor. If they are continuous, they form a pair; conversely, they do not form a pair, and other phase wires need to be tested.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention to not connecting input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/bed-ac-1.webp').default} size="20%" align="center" />
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-gemini/fly-gemini-v3/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for the DC bed should not exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module for the bed to avoid irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for thermistors is as follows. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type to: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a regular NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type to: **Generic 3950**

## Fan Wiring

* **Fan Wiring**

    :::tip

    Fan voltage selection. Short the corresponding voltage pins with a jumper cap, as shown in the following figure. Note: The jumpers in the yellow boxes are the same.
    Warning!!! Choosing the wrong fan voltage may damage the fan or MOS module.

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC). Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **Normally Closed (NC)** so that the system can promptly report errors when there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, avoiding unnecessary crashes and printer damage.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring

### Metal Proximity Switch Wiring

* VORON officially recommends using Omron Omron TL-Q5MC (previously recommended PL08N, which has the same principle but different detection distance) sensors for bed leveling. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-gemini/fly-gemini-v3/img/wiring/pl08.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-Touch has five wires, three of which form the first group responsible for sensor power supply and probe retraction, while the second group consists of ground and signal lines, outputting limit signals. When wiring BL-Touch, carefully verify the wire sequence; incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!! The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-gemini/fly-gemini-v3/img/wiring/bltouch.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with low cost and high stability and value. It is recommended to use. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-gemini/fly-gemini-v3/img/wiring/klicky.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a Z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire tool head moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better precision than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all printing platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, certain versions may cause the Tap sensor to burn out with a probability when using **24V**. This is not a problem with Fly products but a design flaw in Voron Tap. Please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be connected in reverse, otherwise, it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following diagram shows the wiring method for FLY's mini12864. Please consult the respective manufacturer for screens from other manufacturers. Reversing or incorrectly connecting the Mini12864 screen may result in the host computer being unable to connect to the MCU. If the mini12864 screen was previously able to connect to the motherboard's MCU but now cannot, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!
