## Command to execute before adding configuration via SSH
```cfg
wget https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/mirrors/fly/linux-dtb-current-fly-sunxi64_3.3.5_arm64.deb && sudo dpkg -i linux-dtb-current-fly-sunxi64_3.3.5_arm64.deb
```

## Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]                      # FlyOS has already generated the Linux MCU for you, define it to use          
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu 

    [temperature_sensor FLY-Ï€]      # Host machine temperature
    sensor_type: temperature_host


    [temperature_fan core_fan]      # Host machine cooling fan
    pin: host:gpiochip1/gpio103     # Host machine fan pin
    max_power: 1.0
    sensor_type: temperature_host   # Set as the host machine main control temperature
    control:watermark               # Control mode
    target_temp: 48                 # Temperature at which the host machine cooling fan starts
    min_temp: 0                     # Lowest temperature, below this value will cause an error
    max_temp: 90                    # Highest temperature, above this value will cause an error
    off_below: 0.10
    kick_start_time: 0.50
    max_speed: 0.8                  # Maximum speed, 80% of full power operation
    min_speed: 0.3                  # Minimum speed, 30% of full power operation
    ```
