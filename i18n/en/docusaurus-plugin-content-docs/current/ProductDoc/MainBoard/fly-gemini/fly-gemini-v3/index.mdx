## Product Features
    * Onboard computer, can replace Raspberry Pi as the host computer to run, it has 1GB of onboard DDR3 memory.
    * Enhanced 5v power protection, reducing the possibility of chip damage.
    * Cancelled the storage card setting of the MCU chip, making it easier to flash firmware.
    * The system is pre-installed with klipper, moonraker, mainsail, fulidd, klipper-screen, Crowsmest, resonance compensation plugin numpy and FLY-Tools, no need for complex operations such as changing sources, easier for beginners to get started (need to purchase TF card or M2WE)


## Product Parameters

    * CPU: High-performance Allwinner H5 chip, 4-core 64-bit Cortex-A53
    * GPU: High-performance 6-core Mali 450, pixel fill rate greater than 2.7gpixel/s
    * RAM: 1GB DDR3 (shared with GPU)
    * ROM: Supports up to 128GB SDCARD
    * Peripherals: Spi x2, UART x2, USB x4 (USB 2.0 x3, OTG x1), Micro HDMI x1, Eth x1 (100M), CAN x1
    * Interface: Onboard M.2 interface, can expand WIFI, eMMC, etc. (Private protocol, do not connect non-FLY Ï€ dedicated M.2 devices)
    * Supports 12-24V DC power supply, more stable power supply, eliminates the need for a step-down module
    * Reserved a 5V controllable fan interface, which can be used for host computer cooling
    * Reserved CAN expansion interface
    * The system is pre-installed with klipper, moonraker, mainsail, fulidd, klipper-screen, Crowsmest, resonance compensation plugin numpy and FLY-Tools, no need for complex operations such as changing sources, easier for beginners to get started (need to purchase TF card or M2WE)
