# USB Firmware Compilation

    :::tip

    * The Micro4 comes with the Katapult firmware pre-flashed on the USB connection and does not need to be flashed again.

    :::

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <USB />

    * Select GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup, input: gpio8
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-micro/fly-micro4/flash/img/usb.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
    * Press `Q` key, a **Save configuration** prompt will appear, then press `Y` key
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should have been saved and you should have exited to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compilation, it may take some time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the following output appears, the compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Confirm Entering Flash Mode
    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally and ensure that the data cable connecting the peripheral device to the host machine has data transmission capability.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates a problem with the host machine's system, and we are unable to help. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If the instruction `lsusb` is not found, you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-micro/fly-micro4/flash/img/6177.webp').default} size="70%" align="center" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed; the suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. rp2040` has a judgment basis where `XX` means it is variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
