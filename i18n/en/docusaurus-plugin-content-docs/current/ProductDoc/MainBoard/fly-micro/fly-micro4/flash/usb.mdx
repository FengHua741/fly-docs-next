# USB Firmware Compilation

    :::tip

    * Micro4 comes with pre-flashed USB-connected Katapult firmware and does not require re-flashing.

    :::

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <USB />

    * Select GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup, input: gpio8
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-micro/fly-micro4/flash/img/usb.webp').default} size="100%" align="center" />
    * Press the `Q` key, a **Save configuration** prompt will appear, then press `Y`
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now you should have saved the configuration and exited to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, this takes some time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the following content is output at the end, compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Confirm Entering Flash Mode
    * Ensure the host machine can connect to the internet normally and ensure the data cable connecting the host and the device has data transmission capability.
    * After SSH connection to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press enter, if the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback, this is a system issue with the host machine, we are unable to help, you need to replace with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If the instruction `lsusb` is not recognized, you can execute the following command to install it
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-micro/fly-micro4/flash/img/6177.webp').default} size="70%" align="center" /> 
    * `2e8a:6177` is the device you will be using. The suffix `OpenMoko, Inc. rp2040` provides some reference but is not a basis for judgment.
        * Some host machines may display incompletely or not at all due to system issues.
        * If the `lsusb` command displays the device but does not show `2e8a:6177`, try changing the data cable and connecting the motherboard to another USB port on the host machine.

    :::warning Note
        You can only proceed to the next step when `2e8a:6177` is present.
