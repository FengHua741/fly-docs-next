# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper.
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burning, as that is only a precaution in case the Katapult firmware burning was not successful.
* You can quickly press reset twice and check if a LED on the mainboard blinks. If there is one, it indicates that the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware.
