# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of the protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include serial data communication with integrity, providing real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, and having both 11-bit addressing and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard; originally requiring over ten wires, with CAN only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and lowering the wiring difficulty.
This chapter briefly outlines the use of CAN bridging.

## Tool Board Using CAN to Connect Motherboard

* Note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line.

* Note that the 120Î© jumper must be connected.

## Flashing the Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware flashed on the D5 motherboard is `USB bridge CAN firmware configuration`.
