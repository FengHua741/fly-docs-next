## Product Features

    * The motherboard's limit switch and other interfaces are isolated and protected with 5V power supply; if the POWER source is not connected, it will not output power.
    * It uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 series 168 MHz STM32F407 chip.
    * It supports CAN bus and RS232 connections for more stable data transmission with lower latency and more stable connections.
    * The motherboard has BOOT and RESET buttons reserved for users to enter DFU mode via USB for firmware updates.
    * The power interface has reverse polarity protection to avoid burning out the board due to reversed power connections during DIY.
    * It provides two USB 2.0 ports, expanding connection possibilities, with one USB port switchable to RS232 via a switch to accommodate various device connection needs.
