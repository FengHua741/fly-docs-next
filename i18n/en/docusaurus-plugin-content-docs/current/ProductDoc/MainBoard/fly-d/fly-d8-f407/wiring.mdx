### Main Board Drive Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and current is adjusted by regulating the potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers, which require checking the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, and then setting the subdivision via the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers using this mode include: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate asynchronously with the main controller via UART serial communication, and settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can be configured by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers using this mode include: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc., and settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can also be configured by modifying the configuration file.
