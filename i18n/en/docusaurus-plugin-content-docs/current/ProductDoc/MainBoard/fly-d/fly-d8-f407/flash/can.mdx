# USB Bridge to CAN Firmware Burning

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Press the `Q` key, and when **Save configuration** appears, press `Y`
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, this process may take some time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output below is displayed, compilation has been successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```
## Confirm Entering Burning Mode

    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally, and make sure that the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transmission capability.
    * After connecting via SSH to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates a system problem with the host machine, and we are unable to assist. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If there is a prompt saying the `lsusb` command does not exist, you can execute the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed; the suffix `stm32f407xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a variable meaning.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
