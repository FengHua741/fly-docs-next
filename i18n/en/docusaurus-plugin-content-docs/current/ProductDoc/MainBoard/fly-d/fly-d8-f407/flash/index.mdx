    :::tip Notes

# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper.
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burning, as that is only a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully burned.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and check if an LED on the mainboard is flashing. If it is, it indicates that the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware.
