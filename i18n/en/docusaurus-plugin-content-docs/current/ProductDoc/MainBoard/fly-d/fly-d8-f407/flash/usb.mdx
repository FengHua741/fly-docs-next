# USB Firmware Compilation


## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <USB />

    * Press the `Q` key, when **Save configuration** appears, press the `Y` key again
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it will take some time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output below is displayed, compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```
## Confirm if in Burning Mode

    * Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally and that the data cable connecting the host and the device has data transfer capability.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, input `lsusb` and press enter. If the information circled in the picture below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates a problem with the host system, and we are unable to help. You need to replace with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If there is a prompt saying that the `lsusb` command is not found, you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed; the suffix `stm32f407xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a judgment basis meaning that `XX` is variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system problems.
