# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator Light

    * When powered only by TYPE-C without connecting to other mainboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting to mainboard power, the mainboard power light should be on for `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Note

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * At least two LEDs, `3.3V` and `5V`, should be constantly lit when powered only by TYPE-C.

    :::

    * If no lights come on, it indicates a short circuit; please contact customer service.
    * If one of the lights `3.3V` or `5V` is blinking, it also indicates a short circuit; please contact customer service.

## Drivers

    * The mainboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

    * Please pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, if the connections of 5V, GND, and S are incorrect, it could lead to damage of the mainboard.
    * If using a two-wire limit switch, simply connect S and GND.
    * For PL08 and other proximity switches, an external diode must be added to the signal port to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V.

## Firmware

    * Due to button issues, the tutorial has been updated to use Katapult firmware for firmware flashing.
    * It is recommended to use a computer to flash Katapult firmware, then use the Katapult firmware to flash Klipper.
