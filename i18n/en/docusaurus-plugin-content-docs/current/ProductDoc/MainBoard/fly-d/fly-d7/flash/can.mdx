# USB Bridge CAN Firmware Burning

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Press the `Q` key, when **Save configuration** appears, press the `Y` key again.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface.
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it will take some time.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the following content is output at the end, compilation is successful.

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Enter Burning Mode

    :::tip Tip
        D7 models produced after September 1, 2024, already have Katapult firmware installed.
    :::
    * Use a Type-C data cable to connect the main board to the host machine, then **double-click the reset button**, at this time there will be an LED light flashing on the main board.
    :::warning Warning
       * If there is no LED light flashing, please re-flash the Katapult firmware: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-d7/flash/bl#enter-dfu-burning-mode">Flash Katapult Firmware</Button>
       * If there is no LED light flashing, please execute the next step after flashing the Katapult firmware.

## Confirm Whether Burning Mode is Entered

    * Please ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data line connecting the lower-level device to the host machine has data transmission capability.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this is a problem with the host system, and we are unable to help. You need to replace a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If the instruction `lsusb` is not found, you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is **not fixed**; the suffix `stm32f072xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a judgment basis where `XX` means variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system problems.
