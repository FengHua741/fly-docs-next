    Before flashing the firmware, please read this section!!!

:::tip Notes
* D5 has been pre-flashed with Katapult firmware since September 1, 2024.
* After flashing BL once, there is no need to flash BL again (D5's BL is Katapult firmware).
* BL is just a bootloader, used to boot Katapult firmware, and Klipper firmware still needs to be flashed.
