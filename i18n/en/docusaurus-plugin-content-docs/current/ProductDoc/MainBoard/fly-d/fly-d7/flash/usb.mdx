# USB Firmware Compilation


## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <USB />

    * Press the `Q` key, and when **Save configuration** appears, press the `Y` key again.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface.
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it will take some time.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output below is displayed at the end, compilation is successful.

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```

## Enter Burning Mode

    :::tip Tip
        D7 units manufactured after September 1, 2024 already have the Katapult firmware installed.
    :::
    * Use a Type-C data cable to connect the main board to the host machine, then **double-click the reset button**, at which point the LED on the main board will flash.
    :::warning Warning
       * If there is no flashing LED, please re-flash the Katapult firmware: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-d7/flash/bl#enter-dfu-burning-mode">Flash Katapult Firmware</Button>
       * If there is still no flashing LED, please execute the next step after re-flashing the Katapult firmware.

## Confirm Whether Entering Burning Mode

    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally and that the data cable connecting the host and the device has data transmission functionality.
    * After an SSH connection to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates a problem with the host system, and we cannot help. You need to replace with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If the `lsusb` command is not found, you can install it by executing this command:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed; the suffix `stm32f072xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a judgment basis, where `XX` is variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
