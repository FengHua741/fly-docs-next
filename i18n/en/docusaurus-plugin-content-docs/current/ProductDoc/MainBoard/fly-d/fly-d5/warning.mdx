    * When powered only by TYPE-C without connecting to other motherboard power supplies, at least two lights `3.3V` and `5V` should be on
    * After connecting to the motherboard power supply, the motherboard power lights should be on `3.3V`, `5V`, `VCC`

### Problem Troubleshooting


    :::danger Notice

    * Under no external device conditions (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * Only powered by TYPE-C, at least `3.3V` and `5V` two LEDs will be constantly on

    :::

    * If no lights are on, it indicates a short circuit and you need to contact customer service after-sales
    * If one of the `3.3V`, `5V` lights is flashing, it indicates a short circuit and you need to contact customer service after-sales

## Drivers

    * The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Tutorial</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

    * Please pay attention to the wiring order, three-wire limit switches need to be careful with 5V, GND, S these three if connected wrong may cause motherboard damage
    * If two wires are directly connected to S and GND it is fine
    * PL08 and other proximity switches need to connect a diode outside the signal port to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V

## Firmware

    * Due to button issues tutorial update using Katapult firmware for firmware burning
    * It is recommended to use a computer to flash the Katapult firmware and then burn klipper through the Katapult firmware
