# USB Bridge CAN Firmware Burning

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Press the `Q` key, when the **Save configuration** prompt appears, press `Y` again.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface.
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it will take some time.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the following output is displayed at the end, the compilation is successful.

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```
    
## Enter Burning Mode

    :::tip Tip
        The Katapult firmware has been pre-installed on D5 units produced after September 1, 2024.
    :::
    * Connect the main board to the host machine using a Type-C data cable, and **double-click the reset button**, at which point the LED on the main board will flash.
    :::warning Warning
       * If there is no flashing LED, please re-flash the Katapult firmware: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-d5/flash/bl#enter-dfu-burning-mode">Flash Katapult Firmware</Button>
       * If there is no flashing LED, please execute the next step after flashing the Katapult firmware.

## Confirm Burning Mode Entry

    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data line connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transmission capability.
    * After SSH connection to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this is a problem with the host system, and we are unable to help; you need to replace with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If the `lsusb` command is not found, you can run this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not a **fixed ID (it is variable)**. The suffix `stm32f072xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a judgment basis where `XX` means variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
