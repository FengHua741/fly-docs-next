# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. The features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, as well as 11-bit addressing and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the mainboard. Originally, it required more than ten wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, greatly reducing the number of wires and simplifying the wiring process.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using the CAN bridge.

## Tool board uses CAN to connect to the mainboard

    * Note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port, but to the 12V-24V power line
    * Note that the 120Î© jumper must be installed

## Flashing the mainboard firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the D5 mainboard is the `USB bridge CAN firmware configuration`
