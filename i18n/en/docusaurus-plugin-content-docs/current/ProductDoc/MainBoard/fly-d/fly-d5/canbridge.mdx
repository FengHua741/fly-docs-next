# CAN Bridge

The CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications. It can use twisted-pair cables to transmit signals and is one of the most widely used fieldbuses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various components in automobiles, replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of the protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. The characteristics of the CAN protocol include integrity serial data communication, real-time support, a transmission rate of up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
3D printers use the CAN bus to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally requiring more than a dozen wires, using CAN reduces it to only four wires, significantly reducing the number of wires and making wiring easier.
This chapter only provides a brief overview of the use of CAN bridging.

## Tool Board Connecting to Motherboard with CAN

    * Please note that the tool board power cord is not connected to the CAN port, but to the 12V-24v power line
