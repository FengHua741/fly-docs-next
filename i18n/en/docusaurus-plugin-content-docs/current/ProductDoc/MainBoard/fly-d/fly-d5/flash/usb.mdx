    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have returned to the command line interface.
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it will take some time.

    * If the output below is displayed, the compilation is successful.

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```

    - Below is the record of the firmware compilation operation process.

## Entering Burning Mode

    :::tip Tip
        The Katapult firmware has been pre-installed on D5 units produced after September 1, 2024.
    :::
    * Connect the main board to the host machine using a Type-C data cable, then **double-click the reset button**, at which point the LED on the main board will flash.
    :::warning Warning
       * If there is no flashing LED, please re-burn the Katapult firmware: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-d5/flash/bl#entering-dfu-burning-mode">Burn Katapult Firmware</Button>
       * If there is no flashing LED, please execute the next step after burning the Katapult firmware.

## Confirm Whether Burning Mode is Entered

    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the internet normally and that the data cable connecting the host machine and the device has data transfer functionality.
    * After SSH connection to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates an issue with the host system, and we cannot help. You need to replace with a confirmed normal system or change the host machine.
        * If the `lsusb` command is not recognized, you can run this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can serve as a reference but is not fixed; the suffix `stm32f072xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a judgment basis where `XX` is variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
