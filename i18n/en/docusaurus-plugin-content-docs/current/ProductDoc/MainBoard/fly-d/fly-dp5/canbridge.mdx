# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, replacing expensive and bulky wiring harnesses. The robustness of the protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include serial data communication with integrity, providing real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, and addressing capabilities with 11 bits as well as error detection.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the mainboard; originally requiring tens of wires, with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and lowering the difficulty of wiring.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using CAN bridge.

## Tool Board Connecting to Mainboard via CAN

* Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line.

* Please note that the 120Î© jumper must be connected.

## Flashing Mainboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the DP5 mainboard is `USB Bridge CAN Firmware Configuration`.
