## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of which manufacturer produces the two-phase stepper motor, its final appearance corresponds to 4 wires. Regardless of what color they are, black, white, green, yellow, they all correspond to 4 wires. So we need to group the wires into A and B groups.
* For a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, we do not need to know which is the A group or which is the B group; mainly, we just need to determine one group, and modify the motor direction in the configuration.
:::

* In a 3D printer, the most commonly used is a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, as shown in the principle diagram below. There are two methods to identify the stepper motor wiring:
    * Connect any two phase wires together, and if you feel significant resistance when turning the motor shaft by hand, then these two wires belong to the same group. Otherwise, they are not part of the same group, and you need to test the other phase wires.
    * Use a multimeter set to continuity mode to test any two phase wires of the stepper motor. If they are continuous, then they belong to the same group; otherwise, they do not belong to the same group, and you need to test the other phase wires.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention not to mix up the input and output.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for the DC bed cannot exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to connect the bed, otherwise, it may cause irreversible damage to the main board.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for the thermistor is shown in the following figure. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

## Fan Wiring

* **Fan Wiring**

    :::tip

    The red boxed interface in the following figure shows that the top and bottom interfaces are controlled by the same pin for a controllable fan, i.e., one-to-two control.

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) types. Generally, on a 3D printer, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)**. This way, if there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, the system will promptly report an error, avoiding unnecessary crashes and damage to the printer.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring

### Metal Proximity Switch Wiring

* VORON officially recommends using the Omron Omron TL-Q5MC sensor (the official previously recommended PL08N, both have the same principle but different detection distances) for bed leveling. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-d/fly-dp5/img/wiring/pl08.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-Touch has five wires, three of which form the first group responsible for sensor power supply and probe retraction. The second group consists of ground and signal lines, outputting limit signals. When wiring BL-Touch, carefully verify the wire sequence; incorrect wiring can permanently damage the sensor and main board!!!

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with low cost and stable performance, making it highly recommended. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a Z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire toolhead moves to trigger the optical switch, offering better precision than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all printing platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect **24V**, as certain versions using **24V** have a high probability of burning out the Tap sensor. This is not a problem with the Fly product, but a design flaw of Voron Tap, please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Caution: Do not reverse the 5V and GND connections, as this can damage the Tap sensor or even the main board!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The wiring method for the FLY mini12864 is shown in the following figure. Please consult the corresponding manufacturer for screens from other manufacturers. Reversing or misconnecting the Mini12864 screen may prevent the host computer from connecting to the MCU. If the host computer could previously connect to the main board's MCU, but after using the mini12864 screen, it can no longer connect to the MCU, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!

## Connection to Host Computer

* The main board connects to the host computer's USB port via a Type-C interface, or it can also be connected through a serial port to the host computer. Only the former is introduced here.
