# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* The mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to burn Klipper.
* If you are sure that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to perform the last firmware burning of Katapult, as that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully burned.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and see if an LED on the mainboard flashes. If it does, it indicates that the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware.
