# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator Light

    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other mainboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting to mainboard power, the mainboard power light should illuminate `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting

    :::danger Notice

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only through TYPE-C, at least two LEDs, `3.3V` and `5V`, should remain constantly lit.

    :::

    * If no lights come on, it indicates a short circuit; contact customer service for assistance.
    * If one of the `3.3V` or `5V` lights is blinking, it indicates a short circuit; contact customer service for assistance.

## Driver

    * The mainboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Port

    * Pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, if the 5V, GND, and S are connected incorrectly, it may cause damage to the mainboard.
    * If using a two-wire connection, connect S and GND directly.
    * PL08 and other proximity switches require an external diode to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V at the signal port.

## Firmware

    * Due to button issues, the tutorial has been updated to use Katapult firmware for firmware flashing.
    * It is recommended to use a computer to flash Katapult firmware and then use Katapult firmware to flash Klipper.
