# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Important
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult burning Klipper
* If you are sure that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to burn the Katapult firmware at the end, as that is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not burned successfully
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if there is an LED blinking on the mainboard, if so, it means the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need
