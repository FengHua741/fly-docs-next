# USB Bridge CAN Firmware Burning

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Press the `Q` key, when **Save configuration** appears, press the `Y` key again
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should exit to the command line interface
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it will take some time
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the output below is displayed at the end, compilation is successful

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```
## Confirm if in Burning Mode

    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally and that the data cable connecting the lower computer to the host machine has data transfer functionality.
    * After connecting to the host machine via SSH, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the picture below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback, this indicates a system problem with the host machine, and we cannot help. You need to replace a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
        * If there is a提示 of no `lsusb` command, you can execute this command to install:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed and may vary; the suffix `stm32h723xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has a basis for judgment, where `XX` means variable.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
