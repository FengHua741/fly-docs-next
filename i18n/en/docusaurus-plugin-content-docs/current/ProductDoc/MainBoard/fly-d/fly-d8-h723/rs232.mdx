# RS232 Connection

The RS232 standard interface (also known as EIA RS-232) is one of the commonly used serial communication interface standards, widely used for data transmission between various devices. Its stability and reliability make it the preferred communication method for many devices. This protocol uses signal levels different from the standard 5V to transmit wire data, which can minimize signal interference to the greatest extent. In the 3D printer system, compared to CAN, RS232 has a higher data transmission rate, better stability, simpler configuration, and better compatibility with the host computer.

## Tool Board Connecting to Main Board Using RS232

    * Please note that the tool board power cord is not connected to the RS232 signal line, but to the 12V-24v power line

    * D8 main board firmware does not need to be recompiled
