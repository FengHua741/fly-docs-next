## Product Features

    * The motherboard's limit switch and other interfaces have 5V power supply isolation protection; if the POWER supply is not connected, no power will be output.
    * Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 series STM32H723 main control chip with a 550MHz clock speed.
    * Supports CAN bus and RS232 connections for more stable data transmission, lower latency, and more stable connections.
    * The motherboard has reserved BOOT and RESET buttons; users can enter DFU mode via USB to update the firmware.
    * The power interface has reverse polarity protection to prevent the board from burning out due to reversed power lines during DIY.
    * Provides two USB2.0 interfaces, expanding more connection possibilities; one USB interface can be switched to RS232 via a switch to meet the connection needs of various devices.
