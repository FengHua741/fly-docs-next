### Motherboard Drive Jumper

* **STEP/DIR Mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using the jumper cap, and the current is adjusted by adjusting the potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers which need to query the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, and then set the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART Mode.** The most common drivers using this mode include: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main control through UART asynchronous serial communication, and can set the driver's subdivision, running current, mute mode, etc. by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI Mode.** The most common drivers using this mode include: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc., which can also set the driver's subdivision, running current, mute mode, etc. by modifying the configuration file.
