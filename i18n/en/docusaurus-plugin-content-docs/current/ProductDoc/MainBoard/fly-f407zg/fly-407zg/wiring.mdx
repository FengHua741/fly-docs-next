## Driver Installation

### Mainboard Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR Mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and the current is adjusted by potentiometer. Most commonly used are A4988, 8825 drivers which need to refer to the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, then set the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART Mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode are: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate asynchronously with the main controller via UART, and the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc. of the driver can be set by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI Mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode are: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc., which can also set the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc. of the driver by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* The corresponding inspection should be carried out before installing the driver to avoid damaging the driver or the mainboard.
* **FLY Drive:** If the zeroing function without limit switch is not used, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if the zeroing function without limit switch is used, please set the DIP switch to ON position.

    :::danger

    * **Attention!!! When installing the driver module, make sure the direction is correct, i.e., the EN pin should be on the upper left corner, otherwise it may damage the driver or even the mainboard!!! Make sure to attach a heat sink to the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of the manufacturer, the final appearance of two-phase stepper motors corresponds to four wires. Regardless of color, black, white, green, yellow, etc., they all correspond to four wires. So we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For two-phase four-wire stepper motors, we do not need to know which is Group A and which is Group B, mainly determine one group, and modify the motor direction in the configuration.
:::

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used is the two-phase four-wire stepper motor, whose principle is as shown in the figure. There are two methods to identify the wire sequence of the stepper motor:
    * Connect any two phase lines arbitrarily, and feel the resistance when manually turning the motor shaft. If there is obvious resistance, these two phase lines are one group. Conversely, they are not a group, and other phase lines need to be tested.
    * Use a multimeter, adjust it to the continuity setting, and test any two phase lines of the stepper motor. If they are connected, they are one group; conversely, they are not a group, and other phase lines need to be tested.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, pay attention not to connect the input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-f407zg/fly-407zg/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please note the power usage. The maximum current for the DC bed cannot exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to connect the bed, otherwise it may cause irreversible damage to the mainboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for thermistors is as follows. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown below), please configure sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown below), please configure sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC). Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **Normally Closed (NC)**. This way, when there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, the system will report an error in time, avoiding unnecessary crashes and printer damage.

## Autolevel Sensor Wiring



### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has a total of five wires, three of which belong to the first group, responsible for the power supply of the sensor and the retraction of the probe. The second group is the ground line and signal line, outputting limit signals. When wiring the BL-touch, carefully check the wire sequence. Incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and the mainboard!!! The wiring method is as shown in the figure below.

----

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home at a very low cost, with stable performance and high cost-effectiveness, and is highly recommended. The wiring method is as shown in the figure below.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a Z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire toolhead moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better precision than conventional limit switches, and can use almost all printing platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, as some versions may cause the Tap sensor to burn out due to **24V**. This is not a problem with the Fly product, but a design flaw of Voron Tap, please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Attention: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise it may damage the Tap sensor or even the mainboard!!!

## Connection to Host Computer

* The mainboard connects to the host computer's USB port via a Type-B interface, or it can be connected to the host computer via a serial port. Only the former is introduced here.
