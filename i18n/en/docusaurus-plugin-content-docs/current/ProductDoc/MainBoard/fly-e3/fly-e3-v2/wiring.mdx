## Driver Installation

### Mainboard Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR Mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using a jumper cap and the current is adjusted by potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers which need to refer to the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer and then set the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART Mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode are: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate asynchronously with the main controller via UART, and the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., of the driver can be set by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI Mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode are: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. These drivers can also set the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., by modifying the configuration file.

----

### Driver Installation

* The corresponding inspection should be carried out before installing the driver to avoid damaging the driver or the mainboard.
* **FLY Driver:** If the zero-reset function without limit switch is not used, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if the zero-reset function with limit switch is used, please set the DIP switch to ON position.

    :::danger

    * **Attention!! Make sure the insertion direction is correct when installing the driver module, i.e., the EN pin should be at the upper left corner, otherwise it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!! Be sure to attach a heatsink to the driver!!**

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of the manufacturer of the two-phase stepper motor, its final appearance corresponds to 4 wires. No matter what color, black, white, green, yellow, etc., they all correspond to 4 wires. Therefore, we need to group the wires into two groups: A and B.
* For two-phase four-wire stepper motors, we do not need to know which is group A and which is group B, mainly confirming one group is enough, and the motor direction can be modified in the configuration.
:::

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used is the two-phase four-wire stepper motor, whose principle is as shown in the figure. There are two methods to identify the wire sequence of the stepper motor:
    * Connect any two phase wires, and if there is significant resistance when manually turning the motor shaft, these two wires are a pair. Conversely, they are not a pair, and other phase wires need to be tested.
    * Use a multimeter, set it to continuity mode, and test any two phase wires of the stepper motor. If they are connected, they form a pair; conversely, they are not a pair, and other phase wires need to be tested.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention not to connect input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-e3/fly-e3-v2/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current of the DC bed cannot exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module for the bed to avoid irreversible damage to the mainboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method of the thermistor is as follows. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC). Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)** so that the system will report errors in time when there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, avoiding unnecessary collisions and printer damage.

## Autolevel Sensor Wiring



### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has a total of five wires, three of which are the first group responsible for sensor power supply and probe retraction, and the second group is ground and signal line, outputting limit signals. When wiring the BL-touch, carefully check the wiring sequence, incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and the mainboard!!! The wiring method is as shown in the figure below.

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home at extremely low cost, with stable performance and high cost-effectiveness, and is recommended for use. The wiring method is as shown in the figure below.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire toolhead moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better accuracy than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all printing platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, as some versions may cause the Tap sensor to burn out when connected to **24V**, which is not a problem with the Fly product but a design defect of Voron Tap, please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Attention: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise the Tap sensor or even the mainboard may be damaged!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following diagram shows the wiring method of the FLY mini12864. Please consult the corresponding manufacturer for screens from other manufacturers. If the Mini12864 screen is wired incorrectly, it may cause the host computer to fail to connect to the MCU. If the Mini12864 screen was previously able to connect to the mainboard's MCU, but after using the Mini12864 screen it cannot connect to the MCU, try removing the Mini12864 wiring!!!

## Connection to Host Computer

* The mainboard connects to the host computer's USB port via a Type-C interface, or it can be connected to the host computer via serial port. Only the former is introduced here.
