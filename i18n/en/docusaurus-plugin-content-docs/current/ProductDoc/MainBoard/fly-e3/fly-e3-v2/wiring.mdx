## Driver Installation

### Mainboard Driver DIP

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using a jumper cap and the current is adjusted by potentiometer. Most commonly used drivers like A4988, 8825 need to refer to the manufacturer's provided subdivision configuration table, then set the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode are TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main controller via UART asynchronous serial communication, and the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., of the driver can be set by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode are TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. These drivers can also set the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* Drivers need to be checked accordingly before installation to avoid damage to the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY driver:** If you do not use the homing function without limit switches, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if you want to use the homing function without limit switches, please set the DIP switch to ON.

    :::danger

    * **Attention!!! When installing the driver module, make sure the direction is correct, i.e., the EN pin is at the top left, otherwise it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!!! Make sure to attach a heatsink to the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of the manufacturer, two-phase stepper motors will ultimately appear as 4 wires. No matter what color they are, black, white, green, yellow, etc., they correspond to 4 wires. Therefore, we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For two-phase four-wire stepper motors, we don't need to know which is Group A and which is Group B, mainly we just need to confirm one group, and in the configuration, change the motor direction.
:::

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used are two-phase four-wire stepper motors, whose principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the phase sequence of the stepper motor:
    * Connect any two phase wires, turn the motor shaft by hand, if there is significant resistance, then these two wires are a pair. Conversely, they are not a pair, and another phase wire needs to be tested.
    * Use a multimeter, set to continuity mode, test any two phase wires of the stepper motor, if they are connected, then they are a pair; conversely, they are not a pair, and another phase wire needs to be tested.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention to not mixing up the input and output.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-e3/fly-e3-v2/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage, the maximum current for the DC bed should not exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to use the bed, otherwise it may cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for the thermistor is as shown below. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown below), please configure sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown below), please configure sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC). Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **Normally Closed (NC)**, so that when the limit switch circuit has problems, the system will report an error in time, avoiding unnecessary collisions and damage to the printer.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring

### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-Touch has five wires in total, three wires form the first group responsible for the sensor's power supply and the probe's retraction and extension, the second group is the ground and signal line, outputting the limit signal. Please carefully check the wiring sequence when connecting BL-Touch, incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!! The wiring method is as shown below.

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with very low cost and stable performance, making it highly cost-effective and recommended. The wiring method is as shown below.
* Project link: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project link, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a Z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire tool head moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better precision than regular limit switches, and can use almost all printing platforms on the market.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect **24V**, some versions may cause the Tap sensor to burn out with a certain probability when using **24V**, this is not a problem with Fly products, but a design flaw of Voron Tap, please be aware!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following is the wiring method for FLY's mini12864, please consult the corresponding manufacturer for other manufacturers' screens. Reversing or miswiring the Mini12864 screen may cause the host computer to fail to connect to the MCU. If you could previously connect to the motherboard's MCU using the mini12864 screen, but after using the mini12864 screen you can no longer connect to the MCU, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!
