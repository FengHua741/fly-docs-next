# BL Firmware

    :::tip

    * Please note that the `bootloader` has already been pre-flashed at the factory and does not need to be re-flashed.

    :::

## Entering Programming Mode

    :::tip

    The button on the right is the `BOOT` button, and the button on the left is the `RESET` button.

    :::

    * There are two ways to enter programming mode.
    * The first method: With the main board completely powered off, press and hold the BOOT button, then connect one end of the data transfer cable to the main board and the other end to your device.
    * The second method: After connecting one end of the data transfer cable to the main board and the other end to your device, press and hold the BOOT button, then press the RST button, release the RST button first, and finally release the BOOT button.
