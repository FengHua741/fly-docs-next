## Driver Installation

### Mainboard Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR Mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and the current is adjusted by a potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers which need to refer to the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, then set the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART Mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode are: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main controller via UART asynchronous serial communication, and the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., of the driver can be set by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI Mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode are: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. These drivers can also set the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* Drivers should be checked accordingly before installation to avoid damaging the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY Driver:** If the homing without limit switch function is not used, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if the homing without limit switch function is used, please set the DIP switch to ON position.

    :::danger

    * **Attention!!! When installing the driver module, make sure the direction is correct, i.e., the EN pin is at the top left corner, otherwise it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!!! Make sure to attach a heat sink to the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used is the two-phase four-wire stepper motor, and its principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the wiring sequence of the stepper motor:
    1. Short any two wires of the stepper motor's four wires, and manually rotate the motor shaft. If the resistance is very high, these two wires are the same coil group, i.e., A+ and B+ or A- and B-. If it feels as easy to turn as when not shorted, these two wires do not belong to the same coil group.
    2. Use the buzzer mode of the multimeter to measure any two of the four wires. If the buzzer sounds, it means these two wires are the same group. Conversely, they are not the same group, and one of the wires needs to be replaced and remeasured.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention not to connect the input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-cdy/fly-cdy-v3/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for the DC bed cannot exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to connect the bed, otherwise it may cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for thermistors is shown in the following diagram. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown in the following figure), please configure the sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC). Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)**, so that when there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, the system will report an error in time, avoiding unnecessary collisions and printer damage.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring



### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has a total of five wires, three of which form the first group responsible for powering the sensor and retracting the probe, while the second group is ground and signal lines, outputting the limit signal. Please carefully check the wire sequence when wiring the BL-touch, incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!! The wiring method is shown in the following figure.

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with extremely low cost, and it has stable performance and high cost-effectiveness, highly recommended. The wiring method is shown in the following figure.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project address, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire toolhead moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better accuracy than regular limit switches and can be used with almost all print platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, some versions may cause the Tap sensor to burn out with a certain probability when connected to **24V**, this is not a problem of the Fly product, but a design defect of Voron Tap, please note!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following is the wiring method for FLY's mini12864. For screens from other manufacturers, please consult the corresponding manufacturer. Reversing or incorrectly connecting the Mini12864 screen may prevent the host computer from connecting to the MCU. If the mini12864 screen was previously able to connect to the motherboard's MCU, but after using the mini12864 screen it cannot connect to the MCU anymore, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!

## Connection to Host Computer

* The motherboard connects to the host computer's USB port via a Type-C interface, or it can also connect to the host computer via a serial port. Only the former is introduced here.
