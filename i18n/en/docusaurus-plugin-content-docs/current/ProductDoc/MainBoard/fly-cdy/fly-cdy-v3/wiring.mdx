## Driver Installation

### Main Board Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and the current is adjusted by regulating the potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers which need to refer to the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, and then set the subdivision via the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode include: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main controller via UART asynchronous serial communication, and the driver's subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., can be set by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode include: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. These drivers can also set the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* Drivers need to be checked accordingly before installation to avoid damaging the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY drive:** If you do not use the homing function without limit switches, please set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if you want to use the homing function without limit switches, please set the DIP switch to ON.

    :::danger

    * **Attention!!! When installing the driver module, make sure the direction is correct, i.e., the EN pin is at the top left, otherwise it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!!! Make sure to apply a heatsink to the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

* The most commonly used stepper motor in 3D printers is a two-phase four-wire stepper motor, whose principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the sequence of the stepper motor wires:
    1. Short any two of the four wires of the stepper motor and manually turn the motor shaft. If there is great resistance, these two wires belong to the same coil, i.e., A+ and B+ or A- and B-. If it turns as easily as when not shorted, these two wires are not from the same coil.
    2. Use the buzzer function on a multimeter to measure any two of the four wires. If the buzzer sounds, it means these two wires belong to the same coil. Otherwise, they are not from the same coil, and one of them needs to be replaced and measured again.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please pay attention to not connecting the input and output incorrectly.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-cdy/fly-cdy-v3/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC bed:** When connecting the onboard MOS to the DC bed, please pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for the DC bed should not exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to connect the bed, otherwise, it may cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for the thermistor is as shown below. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from fly (as shown below), please configure the sensor_type as: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it is a conventional NTC 100K (as shown below), please configure the sensor_type as: **Generic 3950**

----

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches have two types: normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC). Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)**. This way, when the limit switch circuit has problems, the system will promptly report an error, avoiding unnecessary crashes and damage to the printer.

## Leveling Sensor Wiring



### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-touch has a total of five wires, three of which form the first group, responsible for supplying power to the sensor and controlling the probe's extension and retraction. The second group consists of ground and signal lines, outputting the limit signal. When wiring the BL-touch, carefully verify the wire sequence. Incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!!

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with minimal cost and high stability and cost-effectiveness. It is recommended to use it. The wiring method is as shown below.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire tool head moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better precision than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all printing platforms available on the market.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, as certain versions using **24V** have a probability of burning out the Tap sensor. This is not a problem with the Fly product but a design flaw in Voron Tap, please note!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: 5V and GND cannot be connected in reverse, otherwise it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The following diagram shows the wiring method for the FLY mini12864. For screens from other manufacturers, please consult the corresponding manufacturer. Reversing or miswiring the Mini12864 screen may prevent the host computer from connecting to the MCU. If you could previously connect to the motherboard's MCU using the mini12864 screen, but now cannot connect after using the mini12864, try unplugging the mini12864 wiring!!!

## Connecting to Host Computer

* The motherboard connects to the host computer's USB port via a Type-C interface, or it can be connected through a serial port to the host computer. Only the former is introduced here.
