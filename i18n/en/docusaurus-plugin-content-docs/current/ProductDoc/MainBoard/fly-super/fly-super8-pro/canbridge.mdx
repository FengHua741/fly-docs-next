# CAN Bridging

The CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications. It uses twisted pair cables to transmit signals and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various components in automobiles to replace expensive and bulky wiring harnesses. The robustness of the protocol extends its use to other automation and industrial applications. Characteristics of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication integrity, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
The CAN bus is used in 3D printers to reduce the number of wires needed to connect the print head to the mainboard; originally requiring dozens of wires, with CAN, only four are needed, greatly reducing the number of wires and simplifying the wiring process.
This chapter only briefly outlines the use of bridging CAN.

## Using CAN to Connect Tool Board to Mainboard

    * Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port, but to the 12V-24V power line.

## Flashing the Mainboard Firmware

* Please ensure that the firmware flashed on the SUPER8 PRO mainboard is the `USB Bridging CAN Firmware Configuration`.
