### Mainboard Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and current is adjusted by potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers which require querying the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, then setting the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode are: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate with the main controller via UART asynchronous serial communication, and settings such as subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can be configured by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode are: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. Settings such as subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can also be configured by modifying the configuration file.
