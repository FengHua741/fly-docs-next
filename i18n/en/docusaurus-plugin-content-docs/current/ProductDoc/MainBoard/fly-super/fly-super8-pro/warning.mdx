# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator

* When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other motherboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
* After connecting to motherboard power, the motherboard power light should show `3.3V`, `5V`, and `12V`.
* After connecting drive power 0-2, drive power 3-7, and hotbed power, the power indicator light on the bottom left of the motherboard will light up normally.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Note

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only through TYPE-C, at least two LEDs should remain constantly lit: `3.3V` and `5V`.

    :::

    * If `3.3V` and `5V` do not light up, check the motherboard's 5V jumper.
    * If the issue persists after changing the jumper and confirming that the TYPE-C is supplying power normally, contact customer service.
    * If one of the `3.3V`, `5V`, or `12V` lights is blinking, it indicates a short circuit in a chip; contact customer service.

## Drivers

* Pay attention to the driver power supply, which is divided into two circuits: the first circuit powers drivers 3-7, and the second circuit powers drivers 0-2.
* The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

* Except for the last driver port (Drive7), which has an infinite limit switch jumper, all other driver ports have their infinite limit switch directly connected to the limit switch port.
* If the limit switch port cannot be used, replace the limit switch port or cut off the infinite limit switch pin from the driver.

## Firmware Burning

* The motherboard uses an SD card for firmware burning.
* Due to previous tutorial issues, DFU was used for burning. If you need to update the firmware, you need to <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8-pro/flash/bl">re-burn the BL</Button>
