# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator

* When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other motherboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
* After connecting to motherboard power, the motherboard power light should illuminate `3.3V`, `5V`, and `12V`.
* Only after connecting driver power 0-2, driver power 3-7, and hot bed power will the power indicator light on the lower left of the motherboard light up normally.

### Troubleshooting

    :::danger Notice

* In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
* When powered only through TYPE-C, at least two LEDs should remain constantly lit: `3.3V` and `5V`.

    :::

* If `3.3V` and `5V` do not light up, check the motherboard's 5V jumper.
* If the issue persists after replacing the jumper and confirming that TYPE-C is providing normal power, contact customer service for assistance.
* If one of the lights `3.3V`, `5V`, or `12V` is blinking, it indicates a short circuit in a chip, and you should contact customer service for assistance.

## Drivers

* Please note that the driver power is divided into two circuits: the first circuit powers drivers 3-7, and the second circuit powers drivers 0-2.
* The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

* Except for the last driver port (Drive7) which has an infinite limit switch jumper, all other driver ports have the infinite limit switch directly connected to the limit switch port.
* If the limit switch port is found to be non-functional, consider replacing the limit switch port or trimming the infinite limit switch foot from the driver.
