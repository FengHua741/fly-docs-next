# CAN Bridging

The CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications. It can transmit signals using twisted pair wires, making it one of the most widely used fieldbuses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various components in automobiles, replacing expensive and bulky wiring harnesses. Its robustness extends its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include:

- Serial data communication with integrity
- Real-time support
- Transmission rates up to 1Mb/s
- 11-bit addressing and error detection capabilities

3D printers use the CAN bus to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the mainboard. Originally requiring over a dozen wires, with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing wiring complexity and difficulty.

This chapter briefly outlines the use of CAN bridging.

## Using CAN to Connect the Tool Board to the Mainboard

    * Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line.

## Flashing the Mainboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware flashed onto the SUPER8 mainboard is the `USB CAN Bridging Firmware Configuration`.
