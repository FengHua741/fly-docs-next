# BL firmware

    :::tip

    * Please note that the `bootloader` has already been pre-flashed at the factory and does not need to be flashed again.

    :::

## Enter programming mode


    * There are two ways to enter programming mode.
    * The first method: With the main board completely powered off, short the BOOT pin and then connect the data transfer cable with one end connected to the main board and the other end connected to your device.
    * The second method: After connecting the data transfer cable with one end connected to the main board and the other end connected to your device, short the BOOT pin and then press the RST button, release the RST button, and finally disconnect the shorted BOOT jumper.

            4. Flash firmware
            :::tip
            Only one firmware needs to be flashed.
            :::
            * Below is the firmware flash command
                ```bash
                sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 -D ~/FLY_Katapult/BL/SUPER/SUPER8.bin
                ```
            5. If the content shown at the arrow in the following image says ``File downloaded successfully``, then the flashing was successful.

            :::tip
            After flashing, the main board needs to be completely powered off once.
