### Main Board Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, the subdivision is set by using a jumper cap and the current is adjusted by regulating the potentiometer. The most common ones are A4988, 8825 drivers which need to refer to the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer and then set the subdivision through the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode include: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate asynchronously with the main controller via UART serial communication, and the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., of the driver can be set by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers that use this mode include: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. These can also set the subdivision, operating current, silent mode, etc., of the driver by modifying the configuration file.
