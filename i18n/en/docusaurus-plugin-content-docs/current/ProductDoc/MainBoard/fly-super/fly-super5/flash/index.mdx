    * The Super5 Pro defaults to using an TF card for firmware burning.
    * Please prepare a TF card with a capacity of no more than `32G`.
    * Counterfeit memory cards may cause the burning to fail, so it is recommended to use the memory cards recommended below for updating the firmware.
    * The transmission speed of the TF card should be Class10 or above, it is suggested to use TF cards from brands such as SanDisk.
