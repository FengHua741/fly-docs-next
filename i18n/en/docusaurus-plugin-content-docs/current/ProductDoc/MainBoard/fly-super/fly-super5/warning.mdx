## Power Indicator

* When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other mainboard power, at least two lights `3.3V` and `5V` should be on.
* After connecting to the mainboard power, the mainboard power light should be `3.3V`, `5V`, and `12V`.
* After connecting the drive power 0-2, drive power 3-7, and hot bed power, the power indicator light on the bottom left of the mainboard will light up normally.

### Troubleshooting

    :::danger Notice

    * In the case of no external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only through TYPE-C, at least two LEDs `3.3V` and `5V` should be constantly on.

    :::

* If `3.3V` and `5V` are not lit, check the mainboard's 5V jumper.
* If the issue persists after changing the jumper and confirming that TYPE-C is providing normal power, contact customer service for after-sales support.
* If one of the `3.3V` or `5V` lights is flashing, it indicates a short circuit in a chip, and you need to contact customer service for after-sales support.

## Drivers

* The driver power can use 48V but must use 48V for all drivers.
* The mainboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Port

* If the limit switch port cannot be used, you can replace the limit switch port or cut off the driver's limit switch pin.

## Firmware Burning

* The mainboard uses a TF card for firmware burning.
* Due to tutorial issues, DFU was previously used for burning. If you need to update the firmware, you need to <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8-pro/flash/bl">reburn the BL</Button>
