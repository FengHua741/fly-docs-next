## Driver Installation

### Main Board Driver Jumper

* **STEP/DIR mode.** In this mode, subdivision is set by using a jumper cap, and current is adjusted by regulating the potentiometer. Most commonly, A4988, 8825 drivers require referring to the subdivision configuration table provided by the manufacturer, then setting the subdivision via the jumper cap.
* **UART mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode include: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2226, etc. These driver chips can communicate asynchronously with the main controller via UART, and settings such as driver subdivision, operating current, and silent mode can be configured by modifying the configuration file.
* **SPI mode.** The most common drivers used in this mode include: TMC5160, TMC2130, TMC2240, etc. These drivers can also configure settings like subdivision, operating current, and silent mode by modifying the configuration file.

### Driver Installation

* Drivers need to be checked before installation to avoid damaging the driver or motherboard.
* **FLY Driver:** If the zero-point return function without limit switches is not used, set the DIP switch to position 1; conversely, if the zero-point return function with limit switches is needed, set the DIP switch to ON.

    :::danger

    * **Note!!! Ensure the correct insertion direction when installing the driver module, i.e., the EN pin should be on the top left, otherwise, it may damage the driver or even the motherboard!!! Make sure to attach a heatsink to the driver!!!

## Stepper Motor Wiring

:::info
* Regardless of the manufacturer, two-phase stepper motors ultimately have four wires. Regardless of color, black, white, green, yellow, they all correspond to four wires. Therefore, we need to group the wires into two groups, A and B.
* For two-phase four-wire stepper motors, it's not necessary to know which is Group A and which is Group B; mainly, it's about confirming one group, and adjusting motor direction in the configuration.
:::

* In 3D printers, the most commonly used are two-phase four-wire stepper motors, whose principle is shown in the figure below. There are two methods to identify the wiring sequence of stepper motors:
    * Connect any two phase wires, manually rotate the motor shaft; if there is significant resistance, these two wires belong to one group. Conversely, they do not belong to the same group and need to test other phase wires.
    * Use a multimeter set to continuity mode, test any two phase wires of the stepper motor; if they are connected, they belong to one group; conversely, they do not belong to the same group and need to test other phase wires.

## Bed Wiring

* **AC Bed:** When wiring the solid-state relay, please ensure that the input and output are not reversed.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/bed-ac-1.webp').default} size="20%" align="center" />
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super5/img/wiring/bed-ac-2.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

* **DC Bed:** When connecting the bed to the onboard MOSFET, pay attention to the power usage. The maximum current for a DC bed should not exceed 10A. If it exceeds 10A, it is recommended to use an external MOS module to power the bed, otherwise, it may cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Thermistor Wiring

### Thermistor Type Introduction

* The wiring method for the thermistor is shown below. Please consult the purchasing merchant for the type of thermistor.

* If purchased from FLY (as shown below), please configure the sensor_type to: **ATC Semitec 104GT-2**

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8/img/wiring/ntc-1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

* If it's a regular NTC 100K (as shown below), please configure the sensor_type to: **Generic 3950**

## Fan Wiring

* **Fan Wiring**

    :::tip

    Choose the fan voltage by shorting the corresponding voltage pins with a jumper cap, as shown in the figure below. Note: The jumpers in the yellow boxes are the same.
    Note!!! Choosing the wrong fan voltage may damage the fan or MOS module.

## Limit Switch Wiring

* Limit switches come in normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) types. Generally, in 3D printers, it is recommended to use **normally closed (NC)**, so that if there is a problem with the limit switch circuit, the system will promptly report an error, avoiding unnecessary collisions and printer damage.

**The limit switch voltage on Super8 can be changed by altering the shorted resistor, with options of 3.3V, 5V, 12V, defaulting to 5V. The default voltage is sufficient for most scenarios, no modification is needed. If modification is required, proceed with caution.**

## Level Sensor Wiring

### Metal Proximity Switch Wiring

* VORON officially recommends using the Omron Omron TL-Q5MC sensor (previously the official recommendation was PL08N, both work on the same principle but have different detection distances) for bed leveling. The wiring method is shown below.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super5/img/wiring/pl08.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### BL-Touch Wiring

* BL-Touch has five wires, three for the first group, responsible for sensor power supply and probe retraction, the second group is ground and signal lines, outputting limit signals. Carefully check the wire sequence when wiring BL-Touch, incorrect wiring may permanently damage the sensor and motherboard!!!


    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super5/img/wiring/bltouch.webp').default} size="40%" align="center" />

----

### Klicky Wiring

* Klicky is a third-party leveling sensor that can be made at home with minimal cost and stable performance, offering good value for money. The wiring method is shown below.
* Project Address: [jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe "Project Address, click to jump")

----

### Voron Tap Wiring

* Tap is a Z-probe based on the nozzle, suitable for V2 and Trident printer designs. The entire head moves to trigger the optical switch, providing better accuracy than conventional limit switches and can be used with almost all printing platforms.

    :::warning

    Voron Tap is not recommended to connect to **24V**, some versions using **24V** have a certain probability of burning out the Tap sensor. This is not a problem with the Fly product, but a design flaw of Voron Tap, please note!!!

    :::

    :::danger

    Note: The 5V and GND cannot be reversed, otherwise, it may damage the Tap sensor or even the motherboard!!!

## FLY-Mini12864 LCD Wiring

* The wiring diagram for the FLY mini12864 is shown below, for screens from other manufacturers, please consult the respective manufacturer. Reversing or incorrectly connecting the Mini12864 screen may prevent the host computer from connecting to the MCU. If the Mini12864 screen worked fine before but now cannot connect to the MCU after installation, try unplugging the Mini12864 wiring!!!
