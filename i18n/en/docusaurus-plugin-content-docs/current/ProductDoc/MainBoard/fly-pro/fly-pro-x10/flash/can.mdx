# USB Bridge CAN Firmware Burning

## Start Compilation

    <SSH />

    <MakeOperate/>

    <CAN />

    * Press the `Q` key, and when **Save configuration** appears, press the `Y` key again.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/configuration.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * Now the configuration should be saved and you should have exited to the command line interface.
    * Enter `make -j4` to start compiling, it may take some time.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/make.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />
    * If the following content is output at the end, compilation is successful.

        ```bash
        Linking out/klipper.elf
        Creating hex file out/klipper.bin
        ```


## Confirm Entering Burning Mode

    * Ensure that the host machine can connect to the network normally, and ensure that the data cable connecting the host machine and the device has data transfer capabilities.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press Enter. If the information circled in the image below is displayed, you can proceed to the next step.
        * If there is no feedback at all, this indicates a system issue with the host machine, and we are unable to help. You need to replace it with a confirmed normal system or replace the host machine.
        * If the `lsusb` command is not found, you can execute the following command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
            <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/6177.webp').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 
    * The ID displayed in the red box can be used as a reference but is not fixed, the suffix `stm32h723xx` after `OpenMoko, Inc.` has variable meanings.
        * Some host machines may display incomplete or no information due to system issues.
