## Product Features

    * Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 series STM32H723ZGT6 main control chip with a frequency of 550 MHz
    * The motherboard and core board use a BTB connection method, allowing the use of Orange Pi CM4 and Raspberry Pi CM4 core boards
    * The motherboard has a BOOT button reserved for users to update the motherboard bootloader via DFU mode
    * Ten plug-and-play TP drivers, no jumpers needed to switch drive modes
    * Board-mounted DIAG function pins, can be used with simple plug-and-pull jumpers for unlimited reset
    * Drive power supports HVIN and VIN power selection
    * Can upgrade MCU firmware via MicroSD card, or update MCU firmware through DFU using Klipper's make flash command
    * Six two-wire controllable fans, and support for pluggable MOS, two four-wire fans, one VCC fan
    * Digital fans support 24V, 12V, and 5V voltages, eliminating the need for external voltage conversion modules and reducing the likelihood of motherboard damage
    * Replaceable fuses for easy replacement;
