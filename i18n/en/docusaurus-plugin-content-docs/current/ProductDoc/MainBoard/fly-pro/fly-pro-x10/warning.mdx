# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator
* When using Type-C power supply without connecting other motherboard power, it should light up `SYS_5V` and `SYS_3.3V`.
* After connecting the motherboard power `HVIN`, `VIN`, `BOARO`, `POWER`, the motherboard power light should remain on.

## Driver

* TP5160 and TP2209 are just different names and do not require jumpers to select drive mode.
* The driver port can only install TP drivers and cannot install other devices.

## Limit Port
* ProX10 supports 5V and 12V power selection. Please note that if you use proximity switches, a diode needs to be installed for voltage drop.

## Host Computer
* ProX10 supports using an external host computer. By setting the DIP switch to connect Type-C, it can be used.

## Firmware Burning

* The motherboard supports burning using an TF card, but the factory default is `Katapult`.
* If you need to burn using an TF card, you need to re-burn the BL.
