    :::warning Notes

    * PRO X10 comes pre-flashed with Katapult
    * Once BL has been flashed, there is no need to flash BL again
    * There are two types of BL for PRO X10, one for Katapult firmware and the other for BL flashed from TF card
    * If needed, you can reflash BL according to your choice <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./bl">BL Firmware</Button>

    :::danger Notice
    * Mainboard firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult flashing Klipper
    * If the mainboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burn, as that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware burn was not successful
    * You can quickly press reset twice to see if an LED on the mainboard blinks, indicating that the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware
